	abstract = {Creating product ecosystems has been one of the strategic ways to enhance user experience and business advantages. Among many, customer needs analysis for product ecosystems is one of the most challenging tasks in creating a successful product ecosystem from both the perspectives of marketing research and product development. In this paper, we propose a machine -learning approach to customer needs analysis for product ecosystems by examining a large amount of online user-generated product reviews within a product ecosystem. First, we filtered out uninformative reviews from the informative reviews using a fastText technique. Then, we extract a variety of topics with regard to customer needs using a topic modeling technique named latent Dirichlet allocation. In addition, we applied a rule -based sentiment analysis method to predict not only the sentiment of the reviews but also their sentiment intensity values. Finally, we categorized customer needs related to different topics extracted using an analytic Kano model based on the dissatisfaction -satisfaction pairfrom the sentiment analysis. A case example of the Amazon product ecosystem was used to illustrate the potential and feasibility of the proposed method.},

The process of reviewing multiple concepts provides a means of communicating concepts developed by individual team members and by the team as a whole. Clustering, however, can also require arduous iterations and the resulting clusters may not always be useful to the team. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach on natural language descriptions of concepts that enables an automatic means of clustering. Using data from over 1000 concepts generated by student teams in a graduate new product development class, we provide a comparison between the concept clustering performed manually by the student teams and the work automated by a machine learning algorithm. The goal of our machine learning tool is to support design teams in identifying possible areas of "over-clustering" and/or "under-clustering" in order to enhance divergent concept generation processes.},

	abstract = {Formalisation of heuristic methods for supporting the conceptual design stage of product and technology development has been extensively evolved in industry during the last half of the century and gradually more formally appears in academic context nowadays. Due to the considerable interest from the Industry and the Academia, heuristic approaches such as TRIZ have been strongly developed over the past decades. Thus, TRIZ evolved from a set of empirical inventive principles into a considerably formal approach including techniques for modeling technical problems with the possibility of further overcoming them using formal methods. Moreover, during the last decades, TRIZ has been extensively digitized. Several generations of software have appeared that facilitate the use of inventive methods (Goldfire, Invention Machine). From the trend of digitalisation and the success of machine driven processes, it can be assumed that the further fate of invention methods and formal algorithms for overcoming non-trivial problems lies in the plane of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence approaches. The position of the authors is that the idea of automating inventions looks extremely attractive, although in the coming time, digital approaches will rather complement the intelligence of engineers and scientists, rather than replace it. Taking a certain preparatory step towards AI driven inventions, we present a semantic model that can form the basis of future approaches, at the same time, having already sufficient functionality to support the heuristic stage of technology. As part of this work, over 8 millions of patents and scientific publications have been analyzed to extract semantic concepts. Amodelwas built based onMachine Learning methods and Natural Language Processing techniques with the following discussion and application examples.},

Then, the conceptual design is clustered into a predefined number of clusters (materials) using a machine learning algorithm. Finally, the global optimization problem aims to find the optimal material parameters of the clustered design using metamodels. The metamodels are built using sampling and cross-validation and sequentially updated using an expected improvement function until convergence.

	abstract = {The gradual adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) globally serves as a crucial move toward addressing global decarbonization goals for sustainable development. However, the lack of cost-effective, power-efficient, and safe chargers for EV batteries hampers adoption. Understanding the research needs and identifying the gaps in EV charger innovation informs investments and research to address development challenges. This study developed a unique text mining workflow to classify themes in EV charger technology and product development by analyzing U.S. patent award summaries. The text mining workflow combined the techniques of data extraction, data cleaning, natural language processing (NLP), statistical analysis, and unsupervised machine learning (ML) to extract unique themes and to visualize their relationships. There was a 47.7\% increase in the number of EV charger patents issued in 2022 relative to that in 2018. The top four themes were charging station management, power transfer efficiency, on-board charger design, and temperature management. More than half (53.8\%) of the EV charger patents issued over the five-year period from 2018 to 2022 addressed problems within those four themes. Patents that addressed wireless charging, fast charging, and fleet charging accounted for less than 10\% each of the EV charger patents issued. This suggests that the industry is still at the frontier of addressing those problems. This study further presents examples of the specific EV charger problems addressed within each theme. The findings can inform investment decisions and policymaking to focus on R\&D resources that will advance the state of the art and spur EV adoption.},

In the product design area, various methods for analyzing customer preference for product features have been suggested. However, most of them focused on feature categories rather than product components which are crucial in practical applications. To address that limitation, this paper proposes a new methodology for extracting sub-features from online data. First, the method detects phrases in the data and filtered them using product manual documents. The filtered phrases are embedded into vectors, and then they are divided into several groups by two clustering methods. The resulting clusters are labeled by analyzing items in each cluster. Finally, cue phrases for sub-features are obtained by selecting clusters with labels representing product features. The proposed methodology was tested on smartphone review data. The result provides feature clusters containing sub-feature phrases with high accuracy. The obtained cue phrases will be used in analyzing customer preferences for sub-features and this can help product designers determine the optimal component configuration in embodiment design.},

As the project evolves, the team is expected to develop a shared understanding. However, students often become overwhelmed by the amount of information available and lose sight of the big picture. Instructors may also find it difficult to keep track of individual and team activities and are often forced to evaluate the product instead of the learning process.
This paper presents preliminary results from a tool that supports effective knowledge management for engineering design projects. This framework, called Design Webs, automatically extracts conceptual maps from the team's evolving set of documents and discussions about an engineering artifact. It uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation, hierarchical clustering, and other machine learning techniques to generate a navigable web-based graph. Both instructors and students can browse this graph interactively to explore the concepts embedded inside design team documents and the connections between them. An experiment performed on documents obtained from a project course shows the effectiveness of DesignWebs in synthesizing the design knowledge from multiple sources of information in engineering project teams.},

To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system, we have conducted a case study, based on US automotive market data. In this case study, the proposed DSS achieved a classification accuracy of 92.40\%. The high accuracy levels make us confident that the proposed system can benefit enterprise decision makers by providing an objective second opinion on the question: To which market segment does a new product design belong? Having the information about the market segment implies that the competition is known and marketing can position the product accurately. Furthermore, the design parameters can be adjusted such that (a) the new product fits this market segment better or (b) the new product is positioned in a different market segment. Therefore, the proposed system enables market segment driven product design.},

	abstract = {CNH is a global capital goods company of more than 37000 employees, specializing in equipment and services for Agriculture and Construction. CNHi vehicles cover a vast variety of applications, operating conditions, and environments, making design for reliability one of the main objectives of the company. Warranty claims analysis is a key activity for product support and product development technicians. A widely used source of information is a set of documents, referred to as 'Claim Comments' that are filled in by mechanics during repairs. Repair records include valuable information as failure modes descriptions, diagnosis and troubleshooting, potential causes, and other useful details. The information is then fed back for customer/field support and continuous product improvement. Claims details review is mostly executed manually, and engineers need to read thousands of lines each year. This task is constrained by human limitations - e.g., ability of consistently identifying failure modes and the limited number of documents that can be processed at once. This paper describes a solution to make that kind of massive documents analysis more scalable and efficient. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is not a new discipline in data science; however, the problem was tackled in an innovative way using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and a semantic approach instead of the classic frequentist one. This means that the analysis is not limited to single words occurrences but relies on the whole text context understanding. The core technology is based on a deep neural network called BERT [2] (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) which can read and understand the sentences, their context and enable the identification of the main topics in a set of documents. This solution can build topics-failure modes relationships, fostering an automated cross-system analysis previously unattainable. The developed application connects to the Enterprise Data System (EDS) through workflows embedded in a cloud-computing environment. The cloud environment allows managing large amounts of raw text, develop code, build data pipelines, schedule jobs, and manage distributed computer resources. The outcome is then delivered through dashboards that can easily convey the model's complexity in an interactive platform. Through the dashboards, users can analyze topics/failure modes across thousands of claims in a more efficient and effective way. The modular structure grants flexibility to the process, which is now able to adapt to different contexts and data sources. Main strengths of the developed solution are the automation and increased productivity for product support technicians, faster failure modes identification and prioritization and easier data exploration, presentation and sharing. © 2024 IEEE.},

The transformation of consumer perceptions into product design elements has become the focus of designers. This study develops an automated design generation system for product forms, which assists product designers to rapidly incorporate the consumer perceptions on the product form into the design process. It combines the Kansei engineering theory with the deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN), using the side-view contouring of cars as a case study. A questionnaire is given to the participants for selecting the top six subjective terms perceived by consumers in car styling. Further, 1006 car side views are scored on the six Kansei characteristics using a semantic differential scale. The results are clustered and analysed using fuzzy c-means. Subsequently, the clusters are applied as training datasets for the DCGAN, which generates antagonistic data to support the design process. The results of this study show that the data generated through the proposed method can facilitate designers in adjusting the product shape and realising an efficiently product shape design that matches the consumer's desired imagery. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {The reuse of design knowledge within a specific domain is currently a major research focus in product design. However, the importance of support from cross-domain knowledge is steadily on the increase for product innovative design, which includes multi-domain knowledge recombination, transfer and transformation. As the biggest knowledge provider, patent information plays an irreplaceable role inspiring designers in the conceptual design stage. Nevertheless, it is of a great importance and also an issue to figure out how to efficiently retrieve cross-domain patents. In this paper, we propose a function-based patent knowledge retrieval tool for conceptual design of innovative products. In order to establish the underlying local database, function information, technical terms and International Patent Classification (IPC) information are respectively extracted from patents crawled on Websites to represent function, technology and domain properties, thereby generating a patent knowledge space. Particularly, by using a semi-supervised learning algorithm, function information is automatically classified and labeled by functional basis, into which the design problem is abstracted and interpreted forming a design problem space. By functional basis mapping from the design problem space to the patent knowledge space, we retrieve the required cross-domain patents, which are then clustered and evaluated in accordance with the extracted technology and domain properties. The selected patents are thus purposefully recommended to trigger designers’ creativity. Finally, a case study illustrates the conceptual design process based on the proposed retrieval tool. In addition to that, we conducted an experiment to verify our tool. It demonstrates that our proposed tool can assist designers to generate more ideas and the novelty of ideas is higher. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Synthesizing circuit-, branch-, or order-defects-free planar four-bar mechanism for the motion generation problem has proven to be a difficult problem. These defects render synthesized mechanisms useless to machine designers. Such defects arise from the artificial constraints of formulating the problem as a discrete precision position problem and limitations of the methods, which ignore the continuity information in the input. In this paper, we bring together diverse fields of pattern recognition, machine learning, artificial neural network, and computational kinematics to present a novel approach that solves this problem both efficiently and effectively. At the heart of this approach lies an objective function, which compares the motion as a whole thereby capturing designer's intent. In contrast to widely used structural error or loop-closure equation-based error functions, which convolute the optimization by considering shape, size, position, and orientation of the given task simultaneously, this objective function computes motion difference in a form, which is invariant to similarity transformations. We employ auto-encoder neural networks to create a compact and clustered database of invariant motions of known defect-free linkages, which serve as a good initial choice for further optimization. In spite of highly nonlinear parameters space, our approach discovers a wide pool of defect-free solutions very quickly. We show that by employing proven machine learning techniques, this work could have far-reaching consequences to creating a multitude of useful and creative conceptual design solutions for mechanism synthesis problems, which go beyond planar four-bar linkages. © American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

	abstract = {Analysis of warranty based big data has gained considerable attention due to its potential for improving the quality of products whilst minimizing warranty costs. Similarly, customer feedback information and warranty claims, which are commonly stored in warranty databases might be analyzed to improve quality and reliability and reduce costs in areas, including product development processes, advanced product design, and manufacturing. However, three challenges exist, firstly to accurately identify manufacturing faults from these multiple sources of heterogeneous textual data. Secondly, accurately mapping the identified manufacturing faults with the appropriate design information and thirdly, using these mappings to simultaneously optimize costs, design parameters and tolerances. This paper proposes a Decision Support System (DSS) based on novel integrated stepwise methodologies including ontology-based text mining, self-organizing maps, reliability and cost optimization for identifying manufacturing faults, mapping them to design information and finally optimizing design parameters for maximum reliability and minimum cost respectively. The DSS analyses warranty databases which collect the warranty failure information from the customers in a textual format. To extract the hidden knowledge from this, an ontology-based text mining based approach is adopted. A data mining based approach using Self Organizing Maps (SOM) has been proposed to draw information from the warranty database and to relate it to the manufacturing data. The clusters obtained using SOM are analyzed to identify the critical regions, i.e., sections of the map where maximum defects occur. Finally, to facilitate the correct implementation of design parameter changes, the frequency and type of defects analyzed from warranty data are used to identify areas where improvements have resulted in the greatest reliability for the lowest cost. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {During the initial stages of design, it is critical to conduct design space exploration studies and evaluate the design solutions against given criteria. These criteria correspond to the goals that the current design needs to achieve. When there is high dimensionality, the design space becomes very large which is hard to evaluate comprehensively. Hence, instead of searching the entire design space, multiple clusters are obtained based on the design performance objectives. By only exploring the subsets of the design space, the computational cost is diminished, making the design space exploration studies faster. As a use case, conceptual design of turbofan engines is illustrated since propulsion design necessitates a high dimensional design input. Initial sampling is performed using the design of experiments approach, then the design space is clustered based on specific fuel consumption at cruise and engine weight. Both of the design performance parameters are to be minimized to achieve the optimal design point. The best cluster is chosen and regarded as the new space to be explored. Same procedure is applied by following an iterative design space reduction methodology. Two different clustering algorithms are employed and their performance assessment is made. It is found that K-means clustering11K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning technique, which assigns each data point to a group, given the attributes.

	abstract = {This work introduces a new design algorithm to optimize progressively folding thin-walled structures and in order to improve automotive crashworthiness. The proposed design algorithm is composed of three stages: conceptual thickness distribution, design parameterization, and multi-objective design optimization. The conceptual thickness distribution stage generates an innovative design using a novel one-iteration compliant mechanism approach that triggers progressive folding even on irregular structures under oblique impact. The design parameterization stage optimally segments the conceptual design into a reduced number of clusters using a machine learning K-means algorithm. Finally, the multi-objective design optimization stage finds non-dominated designs of maximum specific energy absorption and minimum peak crushing force. The proposed optimization problem is addressed by a multi-objective genetic algorithm on sequentially updated surrogate models, which are optimally selected from a set of 24 surrogates. The effectiveness of the design algorithm is demonstrated on an S-rail thin-walled structure. The best compromised Pareto design increases specific energy absorption and decreases peak crushing force in the order of 8\% and 12\%, respectively. Copyright © 2015 SAE International.},

	abstract = {The importance of the rule of simulation at a conceptual design stage is pointed out recently. The methodology using multi-objective design optimization and data mining, which is called MODE (Multi-Objective Design Exploration), is helpful to find out design knowledge. In this study, we show that the design knowledge found by MODE is fruitful for decision making at a conceptual design stage of real world example i.e. contour design of a fuel efficient tire. Our procedure of MODE consists of nonlinear FEA (Finite Element Analysis) to predict tire performance, evolutional computation to get desirable solutions including Pareto solution, and data mining to find out design knowledge. SOM (Self-Organizing Map) and decision tree are used to obtain appropriate design variables and their threshold. In this study, SOM with MLS (Moving Least Square) filter is proposed to obtain the structured smooth data of design variables in an objective function space. We can overlook the whole causation with the objective functions and the design variables using this map. On the other hand, the decision tree gives a rule to get the aimed performance balance. In order to demonstrate the validity of the knowledge, we produced prototype tires. The experimental results of them guaranteed the validity and the effectiveness of the knowledge and MODE. Furthermore, the latest fuel efficient tire, which was designed based on the obtained knowledge, was released in July 2013.},

Efficient patent analysis builds R\&D knowledge, reduces new product development time, increases market success, and reduces potential patent infringement. Thus, it is beneficial to automatically and systematically extract information from patent documents in order to improve knowledge sharing and collaboration among R\&D team members. In this research, patents are summarized using a combined ontology based and TF-IDF concept clustering approach. The ontology captures the general knowledge and core meaning of patents in a given domain. Then, the proposed methodology extracts, clusters, and integrates the content of a patent to derive a summary and a cluster tree diagram of key terms. Patents from the International Patent Classification (IPC) codes B25C, B25D, B25F (categories for power hand tools) and B24B, C09G and H011 (categories for chemical mechanical polishing) are used as case studies to evaluate the compression ratio, retention ratio, and classification accuracy of the summarization results. The evaluation uses statistics to represent the summary generation and its compression ratio, the ontology based keyword extraction retention ratio, and the summary classification accuracy. The results show that the ontology based approach yields about the same compression ratio as previous non-ontology based research but yields on average an 11\% improvement for the retention ratio and a 14\% improvement for classification accuracy. © 2009 Systems Engineering Society of China and Springer-Verlag GmbH.},

	abstract = {In variant design, the proliferation of bills of materials makes it difficult for designers to find previous designs that would aid in completing a new design task. This research presents a novel, data mining approach to forming generic bills of materials (GBOMs), entities that represent the different variants in a product family and facilitate the search for similar designs and configuration of new variants. The technical difficulties include: (i) developing families or categories for products, assemblies, and component parts; (ii) generalizing purchased parts and quantifying their similarity; (iii) performing tree union; and (iv) establishing design constraints. These challenges are met through data mining methods such as text and tree mining, a new tree union procedure, and embodying the GBOM and design constraints in constrained XML. The paper concludes with a case study, using data from a manufacturer of nurse call devices, and identifies a new research direction for data mining motivated by the domains of engineering design and information.},

As such, modularisation of CAD assembly models is required to facilitate modular design for OKP. However, to the authors' best knowledge, there has been no research carried out on modularisation of CAD assembly models so far. To bridge this gap and make the best use of existing CAD models, this paper proposes a novel module partition approach, to group existing CAD assembly models into modules based on component dependencies. In this approach, an extraction algorithm was developed to extract assembly information from a given assembly model directly, by using automated programmable interfaces of CAD software tools. The extracted information is processed to generate the component design structure matrix (DSM) representing hierarchical relations and dependency strengths between components. Four popular hierarchical clustering methods were used to work with the component DSM to produce results of module partition. A case study was carried out to illustrate the proposed methods and demonstrate their feasibility. It enables OKP companies to respond rapidly to changing customer requirements and develop customised products in a short period.},

Specifically, it presents a novel clustering-based multilocation search (CMLS) procedure to iteratively improve the fidelity and efficacy of Kriging models in the context of design decisions. The application of this approach will overcome the potential drawback in surrogate-model-based design optimization, namely, the use of surrogate models may result in suboptimal solutions due to the possible smoothing out of the global optimal point if the sampling scheme fails to capture the critical points of interest with enough fidelity or clarity. The paper details how the problem of smoothing out the best (SOB) can remain unsolved in multimodal systems, even if a sequential model updating strategy has been employed, and lead to erroneous outcomes. Alternatively, to overcome the problem of SOB defect, this paper presents the CMLS method that uses a novel clustering-based methodical procedure to screen out distinct potential optimal points for subsequent model validation and updating from a design decision perspective. It is embedded within a genetic algorithm setup to capture the buried, transient, yet inherent data pattern in the design evolution based on the principles of data mining, which are then used to improve the overall performance and effectiveness of surrogate-model-based design optimization. Four illustrative case studies, including a 21 bar truss problem, are detailed to demonstrate the application of the CMLS methodology and the results are discussed.},

	abstract = {As an emerging IT-driven business paradigm, smart product-service system (Smart PSS), which offers not only the smart, connected product (SCP) but also its generated service as a solution bundle, has become a vital research topic. Many research efforts have been devoted to constructing the conceptual design framework by considering SCPs and services simultaneously. However, the following critical issues in Smart PSS conceptual design have not been well addressed: how to improve the solution of Smart PSS in the conceptual design stage to meet user emotional requirements. Aiming to fill the gap, this work proposes a conceptual design method for Smart PSS from the perspective of analyzing user-generated emotions/feelings. Specifically, the relevant tradi-tional products are identified, and their public review data is used to analyze user emotions/feelings in user-product interaction. Interactive emotion board as a new design tool is presented to organize the user-generated emotions/feelings, associated design elements, and the potential design points of the initial solu-tion. And the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is utilized to evaluate the improved solution. To ensure the ef-ficiency of the analysis process, the self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm is utilized in the process of clustering product samples and Kansei words. A case study of smart electric bicycle service system (SEBSS) design is used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. Based on the case study, the proposed approach appears effective in helping with Smart PSS conceptual design.},

First, the CAD assembly model is represented by attribute adjacency graph (AAG) with multiple attributes information, and the similarity between assembly models is evaluated comprehensively by considering part information and assembly relationship information. Then, a weighted graph is constructed for assembly clustering in model repository. Meanwhile, an improved spectral clustering algorithm is given to divide CAD assembly models into different assembly dusters. Subsequently, indexing model is established for each assembly cluster. After that, the process of assembly retrieval based on indexing model mechanism is given in detail.

To unlock the value of unstructured capability information and learn from it, there is a need for developing advanced quantitative methods supported by machine learning and natural language processing techniques. This research proposes a multi-step unsupervised learning methodology using K-means clustering and topic modeling techniques in order to build clusters of suppliers based on their capabilities, extract and organize the manufacturing capability terminology, and discover nontrivial patterns in manufacturing capability corpora. The capability data is extracted either directly from the website of manufacturing firms or from their profiles in e-sourcing portals and directories. Feature extraction and dimensionality reduction process in this work in supported by N-gram extraction and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) methods. The proposed clustering method is validated experimentally based a dataset composed of 150 capability descriptions collected from web-based sourcing directories such as the Thomas Net directory for manufacturing companies.

	abstract = {High fidelity analysis are utilized in modern engineering design optimization problems which involve expensive black-box models. For computation-intensive engineering design problems, efficient global optimization methods must be developed to relieve the computational burden. A new metamodel-based global optimization method using fuzzy clustering for design space reduction (MGO-FCR) is presented. The uniformly distributed initial sample points are generated by Latin hypercube design to construct the radial basis function metamodel, whose accuracy is improved with increasing number of sample points gradually. Fuzzy c-mean method and Gath-Geva clustering method are applied to divide the design space into several small interesting cluster spaces for low and high dimensional problems respectively. Modeling efficiency and accuracy are directly related to the design space, so unconcerned spaces are eliminated by the proposed reduction principle and two pseudo reduction algorithms. The reduction principle is developed to determine whether the current design space should be reduced and which space is eliminated. The first pseudo reduction algorithm improves the speed of clustering, while the second pseudo reduction algorithm ensures the design space to be reduced. Through several numerical benchmark functions, comparative studies with adaptive response surface method, approximated unimodal region elimination method and mode-pursuing sampling are carried out. The optimization results reveal that this method captures the real global optimum for all the numerical benchmark functions. And the number of function evaluations show that the efficiency of this method is favorable especially for high dimensional problems. Based on this global design optimization method, a design optimization of a lifting surface in high speed flow is carried out and this method saves about 10 h compared with genetic algorithms. This method possesses favorable performance on efficiency, robustness and capability of global convergence and gives a new optimization strategy for engineering design optimization problems involving expensive black box models.},

Based on this, we believe that it is necessary to use multiple attributes to describe design knowledge during the knowledge retrieval process. Firstly, an attribute ontology with multi-perspective and multi-granularity is built in the new retrieval model. Therefore, the knowledge documents can be abstracted by the concepts of the ontology. Based on the correlation of the concepts, the clustering theory is introduced into the new model to cluster knowledge documents, and the combined keyword concepts of the clusters are generated as well. The keyword concepts of the clusters, rather than the keyword concepts of documents, are used as the index of the retrieval. During the knowledge matching process, the keywords and their semantic extension of design problems are extracted, and the similarity between the abstract descriptions of the knowledge clusters and design problems is calculated, so the best cluster can be found by the calculated results. Based on the granularity levels of the keywords (concepts) the design problems, finally the documents in the selected cluster are ranked in the order of granularity levels. The selected document by the model is that with the highest relevance and most suitable granularity level about the design problem. In the last section of the paper, we used a simple real case to evaluate the new model, and also develop the scheme of the whole design knowledge retrieval system for the future work.},

The motivation is to facilitate better modularizations that enhance different product attributes in various product lifecycle stages. An experimental framework is developed to evaluate the performance of MDS clustering. Three MDS methods and four ubiquitous clustering methods are compared to reveal the most suitable for DSMs. The experimental results with several examples demonstrate that the effectiveness of MDS clustering, and show the superiority of non-metric MDS, SMACOF (Scaling by MAjorizing a Complicated Function) and hierarchical/cosine methods. These methods are capable of partitioning the product architecture into a set of modules and outperform the Newman-Girven algorithm, which has been extensively applied to DSM clustering. The proposed method is capable of partitioning the product architecture into reasonable modules. In addition, it can produce the optimal modules for any number of clusters, which is favourable especially when the cluster number is a higher managerial decision.},

	abstract = {Adaptable product platforms, which express a platform's modular and scalable combinations, are well suited for representing the complex mechanical composition of series products. Current adaptable platform design methods, however, still have certain limitations, such as an insufficient basis for functional modules classification, unstable classified results due to experience-based thresholds, and limited scope because of a reliance on performance mathematical models. Given the hierarchical model of adaptable platform architecture, a two-stage methodology for adaptable platform design based on quantitative indices and fuzzy arithmetic is proposed in this paper. In the first stage, the variety index and change propagation class are applied to cluster the acquired modules into standardised and flexible ones using visualised fuzzy clustering. In the second stage, common and scalable indices based on product lifecycle factors are developed in order to subdivide the components within flexible modules into common and scalable types. Trapezoidal fuzzy arithmetic is introduced in these two stages to deal with the imprecise, approximate, or qualitative linguistic assessments. The proposed approach is demonstrated using the concrete spaying machine family as an exemplary product. Sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust for the disturbance of design variables. Comparisons with other studies' results point to a higher stability, lower requirements for basic data, and a general effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The proposed method uses a cluster-based structural optimization approach consisting of four steps: conceptual design generation, clustering, metamodel-based global optimization, and cellular material design. The conceptual design is generated using structural optimization methods. K-means clustering is applied to the conceptual design to reduce the dimensional of the design space as well as define the internal architectures of the multimaterial structure. With reduced dimension space, global optimization aims to improve the crashworthiness of the structure can be performed efficiently. The cellular material design incorporates two homogenization methods, namely, energy-based homogenization for linear and nonlinear elastic material models and mean-field homogenization for (fully) nonlinear material models. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using three designs for crashworthiness that include linear, geometrically nonlinear, and nonlinear models.},

	abstract = {Computational design methods provide opportunities to discover novel and diverse designs that traditional optimization approaches cannot find or that use physical phenomena in ways that engineers have overlooked. However, existing methods require supervised objectives to search or optimize for explicit behaviors or functions - e.g., optimizing aerodynamic lift. In contrast, this paper unpacks what it means to discover interesting behaviors or functions we do not know about a priori using data from experiments or simulation in a fully unsupervised way. Doing so enables computers to invent or re-invent new or existing mechanical functions given only measurements of physical fields (e.g., pressure or electromagnetic fields) without directly specifying a set of objectives to optimize.
This paper explores this approach via two related parts. First, we study clustering algorithms that can detect novel device families from simulation data. Specifically, we contribute a modification to the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise algorithm via the use of the silhouette score to reduce excessively granular clusters. Second, we study multiple ways by which we preprocess simulation data to increase its discriminatory power in the context of clustering device behavior. This leads to an insight regarding the important role that a design's representation has in compactly encoding its behavior.
We test our contributions via the task of discovering designs that function as fluidic logic gates. We generate synthetic data that mimics fluidic devices and show that our proposed contributions better discover logic gates, as measured by adjusted Rand score. Specifically, combining our Resolution Selection preprocessing and principal component analysis resulted in the highest and tightest spread of adjusted Rand scores on our tested datasets. This opens up new avenues of research wherein computers can automatically explore different types of physics and then derive new device functions, behaviors, and structures without the need for human labels or guidance.},

One aspect of ensuring a safe system design is the analysis of the impact and risk of potential faults early in the system design process. This early design-stage analysis can be accomplished through function-based reasoning on a qualitative behavior simulation of the system. Reasoning on the functional effect of failures provides designers with the information needed to understand the potential impact of faults. This paper proposes three different methods for evaluating and grouping the results of a function failure analysis and their use in design decision-making. Specifically, a method of clustering failure analysis results based on consequence is presented to identify groups of critical failures. A method of clustering using Latent Class Analysis provides characterization of high-level, emergent system failure behavior Finally, a method of identifying functional similarity provides lists of similar and identical functional effects to a system state of interest. These three methods are applied to the function-based failure analysis results of 677 single and multiple fault scenarios in an electrical power-system. The risk-based clustering found three distinct levels of scenario functional impact. The Latent Class Analysis identified five separate failure modes of the system. Finally, the similarity grouping identified different groups of scenarios with identical and similar functional impact to specific scenarios of interest. The overall goal of this work is to provide a framework for making design decisions that decrease system risks.},

This paper proposes a case-based reasoning (CBR) approach to model beliefs about the uncertainty of a cost of concept. The proposed CBR approach consists of storing information about various products in a knowledge-base, defining a new product concept, retrieving a cluster of products in the knowledge-base that are highly similar to the concept, and adapting the cost of the retrieved product to construct a distribution of the cost of concept.

This methodology entails three main elements: (1) constructing metamodels using either response surface or kriging models to capture unknown system behavior in the original large space; (2) calculating many inexpensive points from the obtained metamodel, clustering these points using the fuzzy c-means clustering method, and choosing an attractive cluster and its corresponding reduced design space; (3) progressively generating sample points to construct kriging models and identify the design optimum within the reduced design space. The proposed methodology is illustrated using the well-known six-hump camel back problem, a highly nonlinear constrained optimization problem, and a real design problem. Through comparison with other methods, it is found that the proposed methodology can intuitively capture promising design regions and can efficiently identify the global or near-global design optimum in the presence of highly nonlinear constraints.

Two main difficulties in dealing with the reviews are finding relevant words related to a product and grouping different words that represent the same product feature. To overcome these difficulties, both lexical and distributional approaches are utilized in the paper. Using distributional information, words are embedded into real vector space using word2vec and then clustered. Using lexical information from WordNet, the head word for each cluster is identified by considering the similarity with the head words of other clusters. A comparison is made between using X-means and iterative c-means clustering with added word similarity information when breaking a cluster. In the case study of wearable technology products, starting from a large number of words, the approach is shown to identify relevant product feature words.},

Previous research on mining user preferences usually assumes that all consumers' preferences are homogenous and does not take differences in consumers' personalities into account. Besides, traditional online review deep mining methods are too broad to focus on precise and detailed mining of customer preferences. To fill the gaps in existing research, our study develops a template matching deep mining method to segment customers and narrow the mining scope of customer group preference, and then proposes a product family lean improvement model. Firstly, K-means and structural change model are applied to cluster customers reliably based on the similarity of user preferences. Secondly, in order to decrease down mining scope of customer group preference, the Improved Deep Structured Semantic Model is designed to determine sentimental polarity sentimental polarity of different groups by matching the standard sentimental polarity review templates and online reviews. Finally, a KANO mapping model is developed to decide the user preferences for product attributes in each customer group according to their sentimental polarity and further summarize the common preferences and personalized preferences of various groups according to the Preference Commonality Measurement Function. Accordingly, product family lean improvement strategies are proposed to provide product developers with improvement directions.

	isbn = {978-0-7918-5482-2},
	abstract = {In product family design the goal is to generate a set of lowest cost products that target specific market niches. Sharing components, called platforms, between different products can minimize duplication of effort, thereby lowering family costs. However, if the products' requirements are too dissimilar, sharing components may compromise the end product; such variance will lead to lower end products being overdesigned and/or higher end products being underdesigned. It is important to identify which components are similar enough, so that sharing does not compromise the individual products' performances.
Most existing product family design methods make decisions a priori about platforms; constraining platforms to be used by every product in the family, or not at all. Methods that simultaneously optimize component sharing and design variable settings have the potential to find better families because product subsets may be more similar to each other than to other subsets of products. Allowing components to be shared between any subset of family members leads to a very large combinatorial problem, and considering large product families can be computationally prohibitive.
This paper proposes a method to identify possible sets of product family platforms by using the pattern recognition technique of fuzzy c-means clustering on component subspaces. Component subspaces are taken from a database of generated design points for the whole family. If components from different products are similar enough to be grouped into the same cluster, then those components could possibly become the same platform. Fuzzy equivalence relations can be extracted from the cluster membership functions that show the binary relationship from one products' component to a different products' component. Ultimately, this method can be used as a platform identification heuristic in a larger product family design methodology. This method is demonstrated by applying it to find possible common components in a family of universal electric motors.},

The system uses genetic algorithms (GAs) to generate a large number of alternative design solutions to the problem and an interface that supports multidimensional visualisation, allowing the designer to interact with the data. A clustering technique based on kernel density estimation is described that identifies clusters in terms of the design variables. The clustering technique combined with 'negative' genetic algorithm search is shown to successfully allow the user to evaluate the robustness of regions in continuous domains. The technique is illustrated on a continuous engineering design problem: rainfall-runoff modelling. Most engineering design problems contain discrete and discontinuous variables and so a modified approach is presented. Visualisation and user interaction is shown to be useful on discrete design data, particularly when the user creates their own clusters in a multiobjective problem. Evaluation of robustness on such problems is often only possible due to the knowledge of an experienced engineer. A practical example from the design of reinforced concrete biaxial columns illustrates how the system promotes decision support in discrete domains. In particular, the implicit knowledge of the engineer, that is difficult to express in a model, can be used to make high-level design decisions. Thus, knowledge discovery and evaluation of robustness is shown to be successfully achieved using visualisation and interaction in either continuous or discrete domains. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, a novel adaptive metamodel-based optimization method called sequential radial basis function using support vector machine is proposed to solve the practical engineering optimization problems involving computationally expensive objective and constraints. The proposed metamodel-based optimization method uses the radial basis function metamodel to approximate the expensive simulations in the interesting sampling region, which is a subregion of the design space. To identify the interesting sampling region, a novel feature space fuzzy c-means clustering method is proposed to obtain the cluster center of superior cheap points classified by support vector machine. The procedure of sequential radial basis function using support vector machine is presented first, and the interesting sampling region and feature space fuzzy c-means clustering methods are discussed in detail. Several numerical benchmark problems are used to compare the proposed method with other well-known metamodel-based design and optimization methods including efficient global optimization, multiple surrogate efficient global optimization methodology, mode-pursuing sampling, constraint importance mode pursuing sampling, and constrained optimization by radial basis function interpolation. The comparison results show that the proposed method generally outperforms the competitive methods in terms of efficiency, convergence, and robustness. Finally, sequential radial basis function using support vector machine is applied in an Earth observation satellite multidisciplinary design optimization problem. The results illustrate that compared with genetic algorithm and sequential quadratic programming, the proposed method can find a better solution with fewer function evaluations, which demonstrates the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method in solving real-world engineering design optimization problems.},

As a result, new multi-objective modular design methods are needed that can consider multiple design objectives, related to both the customers' and the companies' functional, environmental, and economical constraints and objectives. Most previous multi-objective modular design methods create module configurations, in which each module meets all of the design objectives. However, highly distinct independent modules are important for current product replacement processes. This paper presents an innovative multi-objective green modular design method that uses atomic theory and fuzzy clustering to create module configurations, in which each module meets one distinct design objective. This paper also presents case studies that demonstrate the capabilities of the new multi-objective green modular design method.},

This paper presents a product concept generation and selection (PCGS) approach, which was proposed to assist product designers in generating and selecting design alternatives during the product conceptualization stage. In the PCGS, general sorting was adapted for initial requirements acquisition and platform definition; while a fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm was integrated with a design alternatives generation strategy for clustering design options and selecting preferred product concepts. The PCGS deliberates and embeds a psychology-originated method, i.e., sorting technique, to widen domain coverage and improve the effectiveness in initial platform formation. Furthermore, it successfully improves the FCM algorithm in such a way that more accurate clustering results can be obtained. A case study on a wood golf club design was used for illustrating the proposed approach. The results were promising and revealed the potential of the PCGS method. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Family-based product design is an efficient and effective means to realize sufficient product variety, while satisfying a range of customer demands in support for mass customization. This paper presents a knowledge decision support approach to product family design evaluation and selection for mass customization process. Here, product family design is viewed as a selection problem with the following stages: product family (design alternatives) generation, product family design evaluation, and selection for customization. The fundamental issues underlying product family design for mass customization are discussed. Then, a knowledge support framework and its relevant technologies are developed for module-based product family design for mass customization. A systematic fuzzy clustering and ranking model is proposed and discussed in detail. This model supports the imprecision inherent in decision making with fuzzy customers' preference relations and uses fuzzy analysis techniques for evaluation and selection. A neural network technique is also adopted to adjust the membership function to enhance the model. The focus of this paper is on the development of a knowledge-intensive support scheme and a comprehensive systematic fuzzy clustering and ranking methodology for product family design evaluation and selection. A case study and the scenario of knowledge support for power supply family evaluation, selection, and customization are provided for illustration.},

Therefore, this study explores the feasibility of two multi-material spinal disc designs and a clustering-based design variable linking method to achieve efficient and effective optimization. The optimization goal is to enable the implant to have natural stiffnesses for five loading cases. The results show that a biomimetic fiber network is necessary for the disc design. Moreover, the optimization performance of the heuristic derived from a clustering-based method is shown to be a good trade-off between the objective function value and the computational time.},

Design patent data is used in our analysis for two reasons: (1) claims of design patents concern the visual aspects of classes of artifacts; (2) similarity between design patents is captured through a tightly controlled citation process. The cluster analysis is based on constructing a similarity index across all pairs of design patents, followed by applying a divisive graph clustering algorithm to organize design patents into a hierarchical tree. Identified clusters of potentially visually similar design patents are tested for positive association against other grouping criteria that are expected to contain similar designs such as design patents filed by the same designer, design patents filed by the same firm, and design patents assigned to the same patent class category. We discuss the implications of our findings for the study of the emergence and evolution of styles in design.},

	abstract = {Design exploration methods seek to identify sets of candidate designs or regions of the design space that yield desirable performance. Commonly, the dimensionality of the design space exceeds the limited dimensions supported by standard graphical techniques, making it difficult for human designers to visualize or understand the underlying structure of the design space. With standard visualization tools, it is sometimes challenging to visualize a multi-dimensional Pareto frontier, but it is even more difficult to visualize the collections of design (input) variable values that yield those Pareto solutions. It is difficult for a designer to determine not only how many distinct regions of the design (input) space may offer desirable performance but also how those design spaces are structured. In this paper, a form of spectral clustering known as s-neighborhood clustering is proposed for identifying satisfactory regions in the design spaces of multilevel problems. By exploiting properties of graph theory, the number of satisfactory design regions can be determined accurately and efficiently, and the design space can be partitioned. The method is demonstrated to be effective at identifying clusters in a 10 dimensional space. It is also applied to a multilevel materials design problem to demonstrate its efficacy on a realistic design application. Future work intends to visualize each individually identified design region to produce an intuitive mapping of the design space.},

Efficient design adaptation via maximal reusing of existing design can improve product quality, reduce manufacturing cost, and time to market. Understanding of product evolution mechanism is required for design adaptations through rationalized modularity and interfaces. Emerging big sales data provide rich resources for product evolution analysis. To support efficient design adaptations, a framework and associated methods are developed in this work using big sales data for product evolution analysis. Reproduction, mutation, and crossover of product specifications are introduced as specification adaptation operations. Methods are proposed for identification of specification adaptations and estimation of the adaptation probability. Based on modeling and analyzing relationships among product specifications and components, different types of modules and interfaces are proposed through components clustering and their potential operation (mutation, reproduction, and crossover) probabilities. Design recommendations of adaptable product architecture with modules and interfaces are made for facilitating design adaptations. A case study of consumer Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UVAs) illustrates the proposed method. Limitations and potential extensions of the newly developed method are discussed.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes an ontology-based model named design change analysis model to organize the unstructured design properties as a basis for design change management. Design change analysis model is constructed by formalizing the mechanical design specifications in the form of design property network. Benefiting from the fine-grained organization, design change analysis model ensures the objectivity and accuracy of design change impact assessment. Since design change analysis model satisfies the attributions of small-world network, the change impact assessment should focus on more meaningful aspects including the linkage weight, node degree, and long-chain linkages of design change analysis model. With design change analysis model, the changeability of each design property which provides a quantified change propagation measurement could be evaluated. Additionally, different components could be distinguished in design change analysis model by using clustering algorithms without specializing them in advance. Design change analysis model modeled in web ontology language is a semantic enrichment model. It supports the semantic design change management due to the mathematic logic-based semantics of web ontology language and semantic web rule language. These lays a basis for updating changes among heterogeneous product development systems, and acquiring feasible change impacted properties.},

	abstract = {Modular product design (MPD) has attracted significant attention. The concept of sustainability has also received attention in view of the intensifying demands concerning environmental issues. Because the way a product or system is modularized can have implications on its sustainability, investigating MPD and sustainability jointly is important. To this intended joint investigation, we add the concept of a product's key components. Mostly, product competitiveness depends strongly on a few key components; thus, we should logically design products with a concentrated consideration of their key components. However, to the best of our knowledge, only scant research addresses key components. Developing an optimal MPD method, which incorporates key components specification, is the primary motivation for this research. In this paper, we provide a sustainable modular product design approach. A graph-based clustering algorithm is offered to cluster components into modules. A module structure sustainability index (MSSI) is used to find an optimal sustainability module structure. A coffee maker case study is used to illustrate the proposed methodology.},

To tackle this problem, a concept screening method is proposed in this article so as to i) improve the efficiency of evaluating crowdsourcing results; and ii) assist designers in identifying promising design candidates for further evaluation. Firstly, web mining technique is applied to extract textual information from Webs and tokenize text contents into word tags. Secondly, a concept similarity estimation process is designed to calculate the similarity between design requirements and crowdsourced concepts. During the estimation process, three situations are considered: 1) similarity caused by repeated tokens; 2) similarity caused by synonymous tokens; and 3) similarity in terms of design knowledge hierarchy. Finally, concepts are clustered based on their similarities, and the ones, which meet design requirements better, will be identified as promising candidates to be further reviewed by designers. To validate the proposed method, a pilot study on future PC design is presented.},

Then, a customer network is constructed based on the extracted attributes. Finally, the network is partitioned by modularity clustering and the resulting clusters are analyzed by topic frequency. The methodology is implemented to a smartphone review data. The result shows that online customers have different preferences as offline customers do, and they can be divided into separate groups with different tendencies for product features. This can help product designers to draw segment-based design implications from online data.},

	abstract = {Early-stage ideation is a critical step in the design process. Mind maps are a popular tool for generating design concepts and in general for hierarchically organizing design insights. We explore an application for high-level concept synthesis in early stage design, which is typically difficult due to the broad space of options in early stages (e.g., as compared to parametric automation tools which are typically applicable in concept refinement stages or detail design). However, developing a useful mind map often demands a considerable time investment from a diverse design team. To facilitate the process of creating mind maps, we present an approach to crowdsourcing both concepts and binning of said concepts, using a mix of human evaluators and machine learning. The resulting computer-aided mind map has a significantly higher average concept novelty, and no significant difference in average feasibility (quantity can be set independently) as manually generated mind maps, includes distinct concepts, and reduces cost in terms of the designers' time. This approach has the potential to make early-stage ideation faster, scalable and parallelizable, while creating alternative approaches to searching for a breadth and diversity of ideas. Emerging research explores the use of machine learning and other advanced computational techniques to amplify the mind mapping process. This work demonstrates the use of the both the EM-SVD, and HDBSCAN algorithms in an inferential clustering approach to reduce the number of one-to-one comparisons required in forming clusters of concepts. Crowdsourced human effort assists the process for both concept generation and clustering in the mind map. This process provides a viable approach to augment ideation methods, reduces the workload on a design team, and thus provides an efficient and useful machine learning based clustering approach.},

However, conventional segmentation approaches based on one-way cluster analysis techniques have met two special challenges in practice. First, conventional approaches that derive a global result rather than a local one fail to cluster customers into such groups who have similar characteristics on a fraction of variables. Second, since there is no formal mechanism to select appropriate segmentation variables, different combination of variables will obtain different segmentation results, which makes the approaches not quite convincing. To overcome the two limitations, a novel biclustering-based market segmentation method by using customer pain points is proposed in this paper. Different from one-way algorithms clustering only rows or only columns, biclustering algorithms cluster both rows associated with customers and columns associated with customer pain points simultaneously to identify homogenous subgroups of customers with common characteristics towards a subset of segmentation variables. In addition, customer pain points are used to replace traditional segmentation variables in the presented method, which makes the results more reasonable. Subsequently, an illustrated example is studied to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, while existing methods are able to achieve clustering hierarchical delineation of product design structure, they are unable to optimise the digital model. Therefore, this work investigates the intelligent algorithm Self-Organising Feature Mapping (SOM) algorithm and improves it to achieve clustering hierarchical division of product design structures. Firstly, the network structure and learning mode of SOM are analysed to illustrate the advantages of the application of SOM in clustering hierarchical division of product design structures. Secondly, a clustering model for product design structure optimisation based on Design Structure Matrix (DSM) is constructed, including the representation of DSM and optimisation objectives. Then, in order to make up for the defects of SOM network that the convergence time is too long and the accurate clustering information cannot be obtained, a two-stage clustering combination algorithm that combines SOM and K-means is proposed. On the basis of DSM, a product design structure optimisation model based on improved SOM clustering is proposed. Finally, the product design example was tested by a certain model of household air humidifier. The results show that the optimisation model based on SOM-K-means clustering has a better structural clustering hierarchical effect. © 2024, Taiwan Ubiquitous Information CO LTD.

This paper provides an innovative spectral clustering approach that merge team attributes and relationship of teams. To measure the similarity of PD teams, we analyze the similar attributes of team and build structural models to capture the technical communication dependency among teams via the product-organization multi-domain matrix (MDM).

Automatically created product summaries help explorers in choosing best product. It analytically explores the effect of statistical and textual reviews on manufactured goods sales performance. This paper suggested a new multi-text summarization method for distinguishing the best top-most significant sentences of product reviews. Most of the earlier works on review summarization have mainly scrutinized content exploration, which disrespects grave features like writer reliability and conflicting sentiments. We examined above features and established a novel sentence with significance metric. The content and sentiment similitudes were utilized to define the relationship of two sentences. To categorize the top-most sentences, the k-clustering procedure was utilized to divide sentences towards k-groups. The final summarization sentence are selected from k-group. To calculate the efficiency of the suggested approach, we used product review from Amazon. The results show that the suggested method outpaces the other approach, it can provide more complete information about product. This study paper observes the business impression of product reviews. It analytically examines the effect of statistical and textual reviews on manufactured goods sales performance and to accepting their products and challengers’ products, which provide perceptions into their product development progress. © BEIESP.},

As an alternative, research on utilizing online data for user analysis has been actively conducted. Although various methods have been proposed in this domain, most of them focus on the main features or usages of the product. However, from the manufacturer's perspective, sub-features are as crucial as main features or usages, because the preference for sub-features is necessary for component configuration in actual product development. As the first step to solve this problem, this paper proposes a methodology to extract and cluster sub-features by incorporating phrase embedding into the previous word embedding. Also, the presented methodology increases the accuracy and diversity of the clustering result by using X-means clustering as a noise filter and adopting spectral clustering. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

They can be grouped into several categories, including basic requirements, indifferent requirements, reverse requirements, expected requirements, and attractive requirements. Among these, the latter two are crucial for improving customer satisfaction and can be classified as key requirements. However, the literature on identifying key requirements suffers from issues related to subjective interference and the lack of a specific quantitative calculation process. Thus, this study proposes a model for identifying critical customer requirements. First, use Python to run the web crawler for extracting online customer reviews. Second, extract product engineering characteristics using the relevant text mining technology and latent Dirichlet allocation topic clustering algorithm. Third, we combine sentiment analysis and other factors that influence customer satisfaction with the product engineering characteristics to conduct the conjoint analysis and calculate utility values for the product engineering characteristics. Finally, integrate Kano model to formulate the requirements hierarchy rules, determine the final key requirements index, and identify the key customer requirements.

The model is based on multiobjective consideration of developing a new product, including the cost, time, and product reliability. The number of test units, test time, and the percentage of introduced new technologies are considered as decision variables in the model. Varying reliability growth rates are considered for each subsystem in each stage. Product new technologies or contents can be completely introduced in one stage or partially introduced to the product over multiple stages. New product development time limit and budget are considered as constraints in the MO-MS-RGP model. An integrated approach is developed to formulate and solve the proposed MO-MS-RGP problem. The approach starts with a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, called multipleobjective particle swarm optimization to find a set of Pareto optimal solutions. Then, clustering methods are applied to cluster the solutions obtained by the evolutionary algorithm. Finally, the clustered solutions are ranked using a multiple criteria decision making method. A numerical example illustrates the application of the proposed MO-MS-RGP model for the reliability growth planning optimization of a next generation engine development. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

It is observed that the modeling efficiency and accuracy are directly associated with the design space. In order to reduce the complexity of the design space and improve modeling accuracy, a multi-stage design space reduction and metamodeling optimization methodology based on self-organizing maps and fuzzy clustering is proposed in this paper. By using the proposed three-stage optimization approach, the design space is systematically reduced to a relatively small promising region. Self-organizing maps are introduced to act as the preliminary reduction approach through analyzing the underlying mapping relations between design variables and system responses within the original samples. GK (Gustafson \& Kessel) clustering algorithm is employed to determine the proper number of clusters by utilizing clustering validity indices, and sample points are clustered using fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering method with the known number of clusters, so that the search can focus on the most promising area and be better supported by the constructed kriging metamodel. Empirical studies on benchmark problems with multi-humps and two practical nonlinear engineering design problems show the accurate results can be obtained within the reduced design space, which improve the overall efficiency significantly. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

These systems are the next step in manufacturing, allowing the production of any quantity of highly customised and complex products together with the benefits of mass production. In RMSs, products are grouped into families, each of which requires a system configuration. The system is configured to produce the first family of products. Once it is finished, the system is reconfigured in order to produce the second family, and so forth. Therefore, the effectiveness of a RMS depends on the formation of the best set of product families. Therefore, a methodology for grouping products into families, which takes into account the requirements of products in RMSs, is an issue of core importance. These requirements are modularity, commonality, compatibility, reusability, and product demand. The methodology starts by calculating, for each product requirement, a matrix that summarises the similarity between pairs of products. Then, through the use of the AHP methodology, a unique matrix that comprises the similarity values between products is obtained. The Average Linkage Clustering algorithm is applied to this matrix in order to obtain a dendogram that shows the diverse sets of product families that may be formed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The members have various levels of task maturity; experts and novices. The project capability is established through a complex mixing of individual members' abilities. The simple sum total of the members' abilities as individuals is not necessarily equal to the whole project capability. It is difficult to for managers predict the project capability. A new management model is therefore proposed. The model is based on communication among members. A basic idea of the model is that good communication results in high quality products. In the model, communication logs are analyzed by vector space models for calculating similarity between communication logs, and clustering algorithm for classifying the communication logs into every same topic. The size of clusters which are generated by the model indicates project capability. After the management model has been evaluated by small-scale experiments, the model has been adapted to large-scale projects. As a result, the large-scale projects' features have been clarified using the analysis results of the model. © 2004 IEEE.},

Failure identification procedures (such as failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA), failure modes, effects and criticality analysis (FMECA) and fault tree analysis (FTA)) and design of experiments are currently being used for both quality control and for the detection of potential failure modes during the design stage or post-product launch. Although all of these methods have their own advantages, they do not provide the designer with an indication of the predominant failures that should receive considerable attention while the product is being designed. The work presented here proposes a statistical clustering procedure to identify potential failures in the conceptual design stage.

	abstract = {Information sources are invaluable when taking decisions in Product design especially at the front end of the design process. Product families if properly classified, the connectivity of product form and interaction of the features assist the designer in taking good decisions. This paper addresses product classification from the design perspective with respect to Product family as reflected by the product's presence in the market. Ten different models for a product (Wheelchair) was randomly selected and recorded. The choice of the product has no specific implication other than to demonstrate the practicability of this approach. TRIZ principles were employed to perform a 3-level component segregation on each model. A matrix is thereafter drawn for the product family. The models are recorded on the horizontal axis of the matrix while their corresponding features are recorded on the vertical axis. The frequencies of the models and corresponding features are noted on the right hand side of the table. The frequencies were then taken through cluster analysis using the dendrogram on SPSS 20. The result shows the features categorized into three groups which reveals the commonality and association of the features that are Basic, Performance or Luxury according to customers' satisfaction. This approach also shows a quick method that can ease product design decision making because it is systematic and can be used to dissect and analyze products within a product family. This approach can lead to functional analysis, product design specification preparation and product development. © 2006-2014 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

Design engineers are given the opportunity to choose from a range of optimized designs that balance the 'health' of the repaired geometry and the original design intent. The prototype system is tested on a 2D intake design repair example and shows the potential to reduce the reliance on human design experts in the conceptual design phase and improve the stability of the optimization cycle.

	abstract = {During the course of development of Mechanical Engineering, a large number of mechanisms (that is, linkages to perform various types of tasks) have been conceived and developed. Quite a few atlases and catalogues were prepared by the designers of machines and mechanical systems. However, often it is felt that a clustering technique for handling the list of large number of mechanisms can be very useful, if it is developed based on a scientific principle. In this paper, it has been shown that the concept of fuzzy sets can be conveniently used for this purpose, if an adequate number of properly chosen attributes (also called characteristics) are identified. Using two clustering techniques, the mechanisms have been classified in the present work and in future, it may be extended to develop an expert system, which can automate type synthesis phase of mechanical design. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this type of clustering of mechanisms has not been attempted before. Thus, this is the first attempt to cluster the mechanisms based on some quantitative measures. It may help the engineers to carry out type synthesis of the mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Product configuration design is of critical importance in design for mass customization. This paper will investigate two important issues in configuration design. The first issue is requirement configuration and a dependency analysis approach is proposed and implemented to link customer groups with clusters of product specifications. The second issue concerns the engineering configuration and it is modelled as an association relation between clusters of product specifications and configuration alternatives. A novel methodology and architecture are proposed for accomplishing the two configuration tasks and bridging the gap between them. This methodology is based on integration of popular data mining approaches (such as fuzzy clustering and association rule mining) and variable precision rough set. It focuses on the discovery of configuration rules from the purchased products according to customer groups. The proposed methodology is illustrated with a case study of an electrical bicycle.},

	abstract = {In the initial stage of product design, it is essential to define product specifications according to various market niches. An important issue in this process is to provide designers with sufficient design knowledge to find out what customers really want. This paper proposes a data mining method to facilitate this task. The method focuses on mining association rules that reflect the mapping relationship between customer needs and product specifications. Four objectives, support, confidence, interestingness and comprehensibility, are used for evaluating the extracted rules. To solve such a multi-objective problem, a Pareto-based GA is utilized to perform the rule extraction. Through computational experiments on an electrical bicycle case, it is shown that our approach is capable of extracting useful and interesting knowledge from a design database. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},
