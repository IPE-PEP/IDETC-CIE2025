	abstract = {Tire tread patterns have played an important role in the automotive industry because they directly affect automobile performances. The conventional tread pattern development process has successfully produced and manufactured many tire tread patterns. However, a conceptual design process, which is a major part of the whole process, is still time-consuming due to repetitive manual interaction works between designers and engineers. In the worst case, the whole design process must be performed again from the beginning to obtain the required results. In this study, a deep generative tread pattern design framework is proposed to automatically generate various tread patterns satisfying the target tire performances in the conceptual design process. The main concept of the proposed method is that desired tread patterns are obtained through optimization based on integrated functions, which combine generative models and tire performance evaluation functions. To strengthen the effectiveness of the proposed framework, suitable image pre-processing, generative adversarial networks (GANs), two-dimensional (2D) image-based tire performance evaluation functions, design generation, design exploration, and image post-processing methods are proposed with the help of domain knowledge of the tread pattern. The numerical results show that the proposed automatic design framework successfully creates various tread patterns satisfying the target tire performances such as summer, winter, or all-season patterns.},

The paper describes a scenario built in two-stages providing the rationale for the application of data science in engineering design. Furthermore, it describes a demonstrator where usage data are fed back to the early design stage and used to populate value models to reduce the uncertainty in engineering design decision making. The development of a new machine for construction equipment, a wheel loader, is the subject of the demonstration and machine learning algorithms are applied on a dataset built on machine performances and contextual and environmental data. The demonstrator allows the estimation of the fuel consumption of different design concepts and the analysis of the performance variations given by a change in a contextual or environmental variable. Finally, the demonstrator allows the visualization of how much the tested performances of a new design deviate from the original designers' expectations.},

	abstract = {In engineering design, origami structures are frequently characterized by their geometry-shifting behavior, mechanical properties, lightness, and appealing aesthetic qualities. In particular, conical origami structures have attracted increasing attention in recent years owing to their excellent energy absorption performance. However, designing conical structures with customizable geometry and folding morphology has remained a less explored research area. In this paper, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based framework is proposed for the customizable design of conical origami structures. To this end, first, the geometric relationships between the 2D crease patterns and 3D structures have been derived to determine the critical parameters. Subsequently, a data-driven method based on a deep neural network (DNN) is developed to train and predict the relationship among these critical parameters to facilitate the parametric design of conical origami structures. Importantly, although the DNN model is trained based on a limited set of data, error analyses demonstrate that the predicted crease patterns are in satisfactory agreement with analytical solutions, verified by physical models. Moreover, numerical simulations are performed to reveal the folding morphology and ensure the smooth deployment of the origami structures. Finally, the findings of this study indicate that conical origami structures are promising choices for further research and development in the area of lightweight energy-absorption structures.},

This study aims to propose a manufacturing cost prediction process for 3D computer-aided design (CAD) models using explainable artificial intelligence. The proposed process can visualize the machining features of the 3D CAD model that are influencing the increase in manufacturing costs. The proposed process consists of (1) data collection and pre-processing, (2) 3D deep learning architecture exploration, and (3) visualization to explain the prediction results. The proposed deep learning model shows high predictability of manufacturing cost for the computer numerical control (CNC) machined parts. In particular, using 3D gradient-weighted class activation mapping proves that the proposed model not only can detect the CNC machining features but also can differentiate the machining difficulty for the same feature. Using the proposed process, we can provide a design guidance to engineering designers in reducing manufacturing costs during the conceptual design phase. We can also provide real-time quotations and redesign proposals to online manufacturing platform customers.},

	abstract = {Flow pattern is an important engineering design factor in two-phase flow in the chemical, nuclear, and energy industries, given its effects on pressure drop, holdup, and heat and mass transfer. The prediction of two-phase flow patterns through phenomenological models is widely used in both industry and academy. In contrast, as more experimental data become available for gas-liquid flow in pipes, the use of data-driven models to predict flow pattern transition, such as machine learning, has become more reliable. This type of heuristic modeling has a high demand for experimental data, which may not be available in some industrial applications. As a consequence, it may fail to deliver a sufficiently generalized transition prediction. Incorporation of physics in machine learning is being proposed as an alternative to improve prediction and also to reduce the demand for experimental data. This paper evaluates the use of hybrid-physics-data machine learning to predict gas-liquid flow pattern transition in pipes. Random forest and artificial neural network are the chosen tools. A database of experiments available in the open literature was collected and is shared in this work. The performance of the proposed hybrid model is compared with phenomenological and data-driven machine learning models through confusion matrices and graphics. The results show improvement in prediction performance even with a low amount of data for training. The study also suggests that graphical comparison of flow pattern transition boundaries provides better understanding of the performance of the models than the traditional metrics.},

	abstract = {The high computational cost of topology optimization has prevented its widespread use as a generative design tool. To reduce this computational cost, we propose an artificial intelligence approach to drastically accelerate topology optimization without sacrificing its accuracy. The resulting AI-driven topology optimization can fully capture the underlying physics of the problem. As a result, the machine learning model, which consists of a convolutional neural network with residual links, is able to generalize what it learned from the training set to solve a wide variety of problems with different geometries, boundary conditions, mesh sizes, volume fractions and filter radius. We train the machine learning model separately from the topology optimization, which allows us to achieve a considerable speedup (up to 30 times faster than traditional topology optimization). Through several design examples, we demonstrate that the proposed AI-driven topology optimization framework is effective, scalable and efficient. The speedup enabled by the framework makes topology optimization a more attractive tool for engineers in search of lighter and stronger structures, with the potential to revolutionize the engineering design process. Although this work focuses on compliance minimization problems, the proposed framework can be generalized to other objective functions, constraints and physics.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

The approach performs, first, a physics-guided adversarial testing phase to search for test inputs revealing behavioral system inconsistencies, while still falling within the range of foreseeable operational conditions. Then, it proceeds with a physics-informed adversarial training to teach the model the system-related physics domain foreknowledge through iteratively reducing the unwanted output deviations on the previously uncovered counterexamples.

In this article, the flow field over an ABR is predicted using machine learning (ML) algorithms (e.g., random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and convolutional neural network (CNN)) using trained ML models as surrogates for classical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches. The data required for the development of the ML models were obtained from high fidelity Reynolds stress transport model (RSTM)-based simulations. The flow field is approximated as functions of x and y coordinates of locations in the flow field and the velocity at the inlet of the computational domain. The optimal hyperparameters of the trained ML models are determined using validation. The trained ML models can predict the flow field rapidly and exhibit orders of magnitude speedup over conventional CFD approaches. The predicted results of pressure, velocity, and turbulence kinetic energy are compared with the baseline CFD data. It is found that the ML-based surrogate model predictions are as accurate as CFD results. This investigation offers a framework for fast and accurate predictions for a flow scenario that is critically important in engineering design.},

	abstract = {Today digital qualification tools are part of many design processes that make them dependent on long and expensive simulations, leading to limited ability in exploring design alternatives. Conventional surrogate modelling techniques depend on the parametric models and come short in addressing radical design changes. Existing data-driven models lack the ability in dealing with the geometrical complexities. Thus, to address the resulting long development lead time problem in the product development processes and to enable parameter-independent surrogate modelling, this paper proposes a method to use images as input for design evaluation. Using a case study on the curtain airbag design process, a database consisting of 60,000 configurations has been created and labelled using a method based on dynamic relaxation instead of finite element methods. The database is made available online for research benchmark purposes. A convolutional neural network with multiple layers is employed to map the input images to the simulation output. It was concluded that the showcased data-driven method could reduce digital testing and qualification time significantly and contribute to real-time analysis in product development. Designers can utilise images of geometrical information to build real-time prediction models with acceptable accuracy in the early conceptual phases for design space exploration purposes.},

To fill this gap, a contradiction solving method by integrating deep learning and technological evolution patterns for product conceptual design is proposed, which illustrates the mechanism of contradiction transition from the perspective of system evolution and supplies a systematic and model-based design approach. Firstly, generic engineering parameters are extracted to define the underlying contradictions transformed from critical defects which are found out through function modeling and root-conflict analysis. Then, a fully-connected deep neural network with excellent performance is developed to uncover the non-linear relationships between engineering parameters and evolution patterns. Finally, an evolution tree based on the predicted patterns is constructed to visualize transformation potentials of a technical system and help designers generate innovative specific solutions.

	abstract = {Computational methods for kinematic synthesis of mechanisms for motion generation problems require input in the form of precision positions. Given the highly nonlinear nature of the problem, solutions to these methods are overly sensitive to the input-a small perturbation to even a single position of a given motion can change the topology and dimensions of the synthesized mechanisms drastically. Thus, the synthesis becomes a blind iterative process of maneuvering precision positions in the hope of finding good solutions. In this paper, we present a deep-learning-based framework which manages the uncertain user input and provides the user with a higher level control of the design process. The framework also imputes the input with missing information required by the computational algorithms. The approach starts by learning the probability distribution of possible linkage parameters with a deep generative modeling technique, called variational auto encoder (VAE). This facilitates capturing salient features of the user input and relating them with possible linkage parameters. Then, input samples resembling the inferred salient features are generated and fed to the computational methods of kinematic synthesis. The framework postprocesses the solutions and presents the concepts to the user along with a handle to visualize the variants of each concept. We define this approach as variational synthesis of mechanisms. In addition, we also present an alternate end-to-end deep neural network architecture for variational synthesis of linkages. This end-to-end architecture is a conditional-VAE, which approximates the conditional distribution of linkage parameters with respect to a coupler trajectory distribution. The outcome is a probability distribution of kinematic linkages for an unknown coupler path or motion. This framework functions as a bridge between the current state of the art theoretical and computational kinematic methods and machine learning to enable designers to create practical mechanism design solutions.},

A design methodology is presented that significantly enhances the product portfolio design process by eliminating the need for an exhaustive search of all possible product concepts. This is achieved through a decision tree data mining technique that generates a set of product concepts that are subsequently validated in the engineering design using multilevel optimization techniques. The final optimal product portfolio evaluates products based on the following three criteria: (1) it must satisfy customer price and performance expectations (based on the predictive model) defined here as the feasibility criterion; (2) the feasible set of products/ variants validated at the engineering level must generate positive profit that we define as the optimality criterion; (3) the optimal set of products/ variants should be a manageable size as defined by the enterprise decision makers and should therefore not exceed the product portfolio limit. The strength of our work is to reveal the tremendous savings in time and resources that exist when decision tree data mining techniques are incorporated into the product portfolio design and selection process. Using data mining tree generation techniques, a customer data set of 40,000 responses with 576 unique attribute combinations (entire set of possible product concepts) is narrowed down to 46 product concepts and then validated through the multilevel engineering design response of feasible products. A cell phone example is presented and an optimal product portfolio solution is achieved that maximizes company profit, without violating customer product performance expectations.

Although the scientific literature shows several studies on mono-dimensional approaches, the joint use of a 1D single-zone model with an artificial neural network for designing new impellers from pre-engineered ones remains understudied. Such a model was provided in this paper. An application to the case study of an expander-compressor impeller family derived from other existing natural gas liquefaction one was presented. Results proved that the proposed model enabled developing a new family from an existing one, improving the performance while containing design time and computational efforts.},

Predicting explosion overpressure and guiding engineering design is an effective way to reduce the consequences of explosions. This paper presents a novel approach that integrates explosive theory and data science. Starting from the first principle, a dimensionless mathematical formula was constructed based on the explosive theory. Gas species, gas concentration, container parameters, and ignition position were fully considered by the formula, and built into data sets using machine learning techniques as characteristic parameters. The SVR algorithm, the BP algorithm, and the DNN algorithm all attest to the superiority. And the predictive physical consistency of this method has been proven. Simultaneously, the dataset constructed by this method effectively reduces the number of features. The PSO algorithm was used for parameter optimization based on the DNN algorithm guided by theory for building F-P (First principle) PSO-DNN Model. In the comparison of prediction results, the mean relative error of the F-P PSO-DNN model is 15\%, 19\% lower than that of the best performing Molkov model.},

As a global automotive supplier, Mubea develops novel manufacturing technologies for new products in the electric powertrain. One example in the battery case of battery electric vehicles is the thermal management system of the traction batteries-a key factor in the battery case. As a new production technology for this product, the Mubea Rollbonding Process of aluminum offers several advantages, such as a high design freedom of the channel structure. For the product development-even though Mubea consequently makes use of automated simulation workflows-the turn-around time of a single CFD performance evaluation is still high. Therefore, our goal is to use all the historic simulation results from past projects to build a predictive model that allows the prediction of simulation results in real-time. However, given the high freedom in the design space allowed by the Rollbonding process, standard Machine Learning approaches, based on parameters, are not suitable. Hence, there is the need to directly process 3D geometries as such. Using historical engineering data, the unique deep learning approach of Neural Concept is able to predict unseen designs in seconds rather than hours, directly from the raw CAD file. This innovative approach allows Mubea to iterate faster and shorten the response time on customer enquiries. In conjunction with other design disciplines and manufacturing data, we look forward to have not only an AI-based design evaluation but also a tolerance-aware design optimization. In this paper we present an innovative strategy to utilize historic simulation results, and the corresponding 3D geometries, to predict the performance of new designs instantaneously. After explaining the underlying approach, first results are discussed. It can be shown that with as little as 100 training samples, this approach is able to deliver predictions with sufficient accuracy and over 90\% of lead-time reduction. Finally, we explain how Neural Concept and Mubea are collaborating to embed this approach in the Mubea design and simulation environment.},

To achieve the intelligent design of the whole process for mechanical product development, an approach based on cases and knowledge is proposed. First, considering that the actual product cases sample is small, correlations among product features and relationships between product features and requirements are evaluated based on design knowledge. According to these correlations and relationships, a design problem is decomposed into multiple parallel small-scale sub-problems not only to increase data samples but reduce data dimensions. Moreover, a hybrid method that combined Hamming distance with Euclidean distance is generated to retrieve similar cases, which can address both numerical and encoding factors. In addition, K-NearestNeighbor (KNN) algorithm and Linear regression are adopted to adapt the classification and numeric parameters, respectively, so that the detailed design process can be achieved without fixed knowledge template. Finally, a tool design software is developed based on Visual studio 2015 to verify the practicability of the proposed method.},

Managers usually rely on surveys, intuition, and heuristics to forecast new products. Linear statistical tools used to predict demand for existing products are not suitable because there are not enough data to capture complex nonlinear relations in yet-to-be launched products. Other tools are appropriate for aggregate new categories but not for incremental company-specific products. Machine learning can capture complex nonlinear relations, but it usually requires significant amounts of data. Using an expert's domain knowledge can circumvent the need for vast training datasets. To support product development activities, we propose a method that combines domain knowledge and machine learning to forecast market share of complex incremental new products. An experiment from the automobile industry shows the approach yields expressive results (82 percent forecast accuracy).},

In this method, the fully connected DNN is incorporated into the conventional level set methods to construct an effective approach for structural topology optimization. The implicit function of level set is described by fully connected DNNs. A DNN-based level set optimization method is proposed, where the Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations (PDEs) are transformed into parametrized ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The zero-level set of implicit function is updated through updating the weights and biases of networks. The parametrized reinitialization is applied periodically to prevent the implicit function from being too steep or too flat in the vicinity of its zero-level set. The proposed method is implemented in the framework of minimum compliance, which is a well-known benchmark for topology optimization. In practice, designers desire to have multiple design options, where they can choose a better conceptual design base on their design experience. One of the major advantages of the DNN-based level set method is capable to generate diverse and competitive designs with different network architectures.

This paper aims to present a machine learning framework for using big data analytics to predict the reliability of solder joints. The purpose of this study is to accurately predict the reliability of solder joints by using big data analytics.

Findings
A machine learning framework for predicting the life of solder joints accurately has been developed in this study. To validate its accuracy and efficiency, it is applied to predict the long-term reliability of lead-free Sn96.5Ag3.0Cu0.5 (SAC305) for three commonly used surface finishes such OSP, ENIG and IAg. The obtained results show that the predicted failure based on the machine learning method is much more accurate than the Weibull method. In addition, solder ball/bump joint failure modes are identified based on various solder joint failures reported in the literature.
Originality/value
The ability to predict thermal fatigue life accurately is extremely valuable to the industry because it saves time and cost for product development and optimization.},

This research proposes a stochastic-based support tool that addresses this problem. A Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) is used to represent the causal links between design variables. Included in this research is an efficient method for learning a design domain network from previous design data in the structure of a morphological design chart. This induction algorithm is based on information content. A user interface is proposed to support dynamically searching the conceptual design space, based on a partial design specification. This support tool is empirically compared against a more traditional search process. While no compelling evidence is produced to support the stochastic-based approach, an interesting broader design search behaviour emerges from observations of the use of the stochastic design support tool.

In order to overcome these challenges, we propose using geometrical deep learning-based surrogate modelling trained with CFD simulations for maritime applications combined with automatic hyperparameters tuning. Our proposed framework can predict both flow fields (e.g pressure field) on the surface of the geometry and any overall scalar parameters (e.g drag force) given a three-dimensional shape input. Furthermore, proposed deep learning model is extended to provide uncertainty quantification over its predictions (assuming CFD as ground truth). Finally, our proposed deep learning-based surrogate model is applied to predict pressure distribution and drag force for wind drag and calm water-resistance of high-speed craft. Despite the common drawback of deep learning-based algorithms to require large datasets for training, our proposed solution can maintain high prediction accuracy even when trained with a very small dataset which makes it highly suitable for use during design optimisations.},

Costs are one criterion for selecting the most suitable manufacturing technology for a component. Therefore, they must be considered for an automated technology selection in part screening approaches. These costs arise during the component manufacture, during the transport of the components to the production site, and within the factory's assembly line. However, holistic cost data is not available at an early stage during product development. Hence, these information gaps must be filled to ensure the correct selection of a component's manufacturing technology. This paper first analyzes the cost data of past product developments regarding potential differences between manufacturing technologies. Abstracted geometric part information and production-related aspects are derived and predicted to serve as input features for the subsequent cost prediction. These AI-based cost prediction models are trained for relevant cost types along the part's lifecycle. The most capable prediction models are combined into a manufacturing technology-dependent cost analysis of the components. Based on that, the forecasted costs of different manufacturing scenarios represent one input for the overarching part screening methodology to select the most suitable manufacturing technology for each component.(c) 2022 CIRP.},

Typically, material costs comprise a large part of total manufacturing costs, and therefore obtaining an early estimate of material costs can help businesses in predicting the total manufacturing costs more accurately. At the early stage of product development, with many imponderables and frequent design modifications, it would be impractical to obtain quotations from suppliers. We, therefore, developed a two-stage machine learning scheme estimating the material cost to guide alternative product design choices that yield a lower total manufacturing cost. Our innovative two-stage technique for cost estimation is meant to overcome this issue. In this paper, we demonstrate that neural networks, a prevalent technique in the literature, can be enhanced by adding the concept of modularity to the estimation of the pricing of technical components already during the design process of a new product.},

The method uses spatial grammars embodied in character-recurrent neural networks (char-RNNs) to define the system including actuator numbers and degrees of freedom, reinforcement learning to optimize actuator behavior, and physics-based simulation systems to determine performance and provide (re)training data for the char-RNN. Compared to parametric design optimization with fixed numbers of inputs, using grammars and char-RNNs allows for a more complex, combinatorial infinite design space. In the proposed method, the char-RNN is first trained to learn a spatial grammar that defines the assembly layout, component geometries, material properties, and arbitrary numbers and degrees of freedom of actuators. Next, generated designs are evaluated using a physics-based environment, with an inner optimization loop using reinforcement learning to determine the best control policy for the actuators. The resulting design is thus optimized for both form and behavior, generated by a char-RNN embodying a high-performing grammar. Two evaluative case studies are presented using the design of the modular sailing craft. The first case study optimizes the design without actuated surfaces, allowing the char-RNN to understand the semantics of high-performing designs. The second case study extends the first by incorporating controllable actuators requiring an inner loop behavioral optimization.

Surrogate modeling is a technique for simplifying complex models that reduces computational time. In this work, a surrogate aerodynamic model, based on the implementation of a multilayer perceptron (MLP), is presented. The input data consist of geometrical characteristics of the wing and airfoil and flight conditions. Some of the MLP hyperparameters are defined using evolutionary algorithms, learning curves, and cross-validation methods. The MLP predicts the aerodynamic coefficients (drag, lift, and pitching moment) with high agreement with the substituted aerodynamic model. The MLP can predict the aerodynamic characteristics of compressible flow up to 0.6 M. The developed MLP has achieved up to almost 800 times faster in computing time than the model on which it was trained. The application of the developed MLP will enable the rapid study of the effects of changes in various parameters and flight conditions on flight performance, related to the design and modernization of new vehicles.},

A comprehensive numerical analysis involving 120 cases was conducted to obtain Nusselt numbers and friction factors, considering different dimple depths and velocities for both pure water and water-Al2O3 nanofluid at 1\%, 2\%, and 3\% volume concentrations. Utilizing the data acquired from the numerical simulations, a correlation equation, SVM ANN architectures were developed. The predictive capabilities of the statistical approach, ANN, and SVM models for Nusselt number distribution and friction factor were meticulously assessed through mean average percentage error (MAPE) and correlation coefficients (R2). The research findings reveal that machine learning techniques offer a highly effective approach for accurately predicting heat transfer performance in a dimpled tube, with results closely aligned with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Particularly noteworthy is the superior performance of the ANN model, demonstrating the most precise predictions with an error rate of 2.54\% and an impressive R2 value of 0.9978 for Nusselt number prediction. In comparison, the regression model achieved an average error rate of 6.14\% with an R2 value of 0.8623, and the SVM model yielded an RMSE value of 2.984\% with an R2 value of 0.9154 for Nusselt number prediction. These outcomes underscore the ANN model's ability to effectively capture complex patterns within the data, resulting in highly accurate predictions. In conclusion, this research showcases the promising potential of machine learning techniques in accurately forecasting heat transfer performance in dimpled tubes. The developed ANN model exhibits notable superiority in predicting Nusselt numbers, making it a valuable tool for enhancing thermal system analyses and engineering design optimization.},

	abstract = {The consideration of sustainability aspects in initial stages of product development is understood as an effective approach to plan a sustainable product life cycle. It can be achieved by integrating the sustainability consider-ations into decision making of companies in early design phases. This study aims to develop an Artificial In-telligence (AI) tool that can assist the designers in their decision making to choose environmentally benign design parameters of products. The proposed tool is based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model which takes the life cycle design parameters (viz. size of product, density of material, manufacturing process, transport mode and recyclability) as inputs and provides the corresponding outputs in terms of 'carbon footprint' and 'life cycle cost' of a product. These outputs assist the designers to realize the trade-off between the environmental load and cost effectiveness of a design alternative. Thus, it enables the decision making of companies to select a more sus-tainable design. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is developed for the AI tool so that the designers can efficiently use this tool. The results predicted by the proposed tool are compared with the results obtained through the life cycle assessment carried out by using GaBi 9.2. The comparison shows that the results predicted by the tool have a reasonable accuracy of more than 90\% which is significant, especially in the design stages of environmentally conscious product development. Also, the time efficiency of the tool to compute the environmental impact was compared with that of GaBi 9.2 by using a T-test. Results showed that the time efficiency of the proposed AI tool is significantly higher than that of GaBi 9.2.},

	abstract = {The inverse approach is computationally efficient in aerodynamic design as the desired target performance distribution is prespecified. However, it has some significant limitations that prevent it from achieving full efficiency. First, the iterative procedure should be repeated whenever the specified target distribution changes. Target distribution optimization can be performed to clarify the ambiguity in specifying this distribution, but several additional problems arise in this process such as loss of the representation capacity due to parameterization of the distribution, excessive constraints for a realistic distribution, inaccuracy of quantities of interest due to theoretical/empirical predictions, and the impossibility of explicitly imposing geometric constraints. To deal with these issues, a novel inverse design optimization framework with a two-step deep learning approach is proposed. A variational autoencoder and multi-layer perceptron are used to generate a realistic target distribution and predict the quantities of interest and shape parameters from the generated distribution, respectively. Then, target distribution optimization is performed as the inverse design optimization. The proposed framework applies active learning and transfer learning techniques to improve accuracy and efficiency. Finally, the framework is validated through aerodynamic shape optimizations of the wind turbine airfoil. Their results show that this framework is accurate, efficient, and flexible to be applied to other inverse design engineering applications.},

While the engineering design community has numerous tools for managing the interface between functional goals in products, there are currently no formalized methods to concurrently optimize stylistic form and functional requirements. This research develops a method to coordinate seemingly disparate but highly related goals of stylistic form and functional constraints in computational design. An artificial neural network (ANN) based machine learning system was developed to model surveyed consumer judgments of stylistic form quantitatively. Coupling this quantitative model of stylistic form with a genetic algorithm (GA) enables computers to concurrently account for multiple objectives in the domains of stylistic form and more traditional functional performance evaluation within the same quantitative framework. This coupling then opens the door for computers to automatically generate products that not only work well but also convey desired styles to consumers. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4007304]},

Taking numerical and experimental data as the training data, the present work proposed a data-driven rapid prediction model to solve this problem, which utilized the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to construct a nonlinear implicit mapping between design variables and aerodynamic forces of high-speed train. Within this framework, it is a key issue to achieve the consistency and auto-extraction of design variables for any given streamlined shape. A general parameterization method for the streamlined shape which adopted the idea of step-by-step modeling has been proposed. Taking aerodynamic drag as the prediction objective, the effectiveness of the model was verified. The results show that the proposed model can be successfully used for performance evaluation of high-speed trains. Keeping a comparable prediction accuracy with numerical simulations, the efficiency of the rapid prediction model can be improved by more than 90\%. With the enrichment of data for the training set, the prediction accuracy of the rapid prediction model can be continuously improved.

	abstract = {Ship design is related to several disciplines such as hydrostatic, resistance, propulsion and economic. The traditional ship design process only involves independent design optimization with some regression formulas within each discipline and there is no guarantee to achieve the optimum design. At the same time, it is crucial to improve the efficiency of modern ship design. Nowadays, the methods of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been brought into the ship design optimization. However, there are still some problems such as calculation precision and time consumption especially when CFD software is inlaid into the optimization procedure. Modeling is a far-ranging and all-around subject, and its precision directly affects the scientific decision in future. How to establish an accurate approximation model instead of the CFD calculation will be the key problem. The Support Vector Machines (SVM), a new general machine learning method based on the frame of statistical learning theory, may solve the problems in sample space and be an effective method of processing the non-liner classification and regression. The classical SVR has two parameters to control the errors. A new algorithm of Support Vector Regression proposed in this article has only one parameter to control the errors, adds b(2)/2 to the item of confidence interval at the same time, and adopts the Laplace loss function. It is named Single-parameter Lagrangian Support Vector Regression (SPL-SVR). This effective algorithm can improve the operation speed of program to a certain extent, and has better fitting precision. In practical design of ship, Design of Experiment (DOE) and the proposed support vector regression algorithm are applied to ship design optimization to construct statistical approximation model in this paper. The support vector regression algorithm approximates the optimization model and is updated during the optimization process to improve accuracy. The result indicates that the SPL-SVR method to establish approximate models can effectively solve complex engineering design optimization problem. Finally, some suggestions on the future improvements are proposed.},

	abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been extensively used as a simulation tool for product development in various industrial fields. Engineers sequentially query the CFD simulator to evaluate their design instances, during which they improve the new designs based on previous evaluations. The high cost of performing CFD simulations for numerous design instances is a practical challenge. To reduce this cost, machine learning (ML) approaches have been employed to approximate CFD simulations. Although ML enables the fast approximation of CFD, it can suffer from low accuracy when making predictions for design instances that significantly deviate from the training dataset. In this study, we propose a CFD-ML combined system based on stream-based active learning to utilize the CFD simulator cost-efficiently. The proposed method has two main objectives: reducing the number of CFD simulations and ensuring high accuracy of the ML approximations. When a design instance is queried, the CFD-ML system interchangeably uses the CFD simulator and the ML model depending on the predictive uncertainty of the ML model. If the uncertainty of the ML model is high, the CFD simulator is used to obtain an evaluation result, which is subsequently used to enhance the ML model. Conversely, if the uncertainty is low, the ML model is used to obtain an approximated evaluation result. The CFD-ML system reduces computational costs compared to exclusive reliance on the CFD simulator and yields more accurate evaluations compared to exclusive reliance on the ML model. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method through a case study on a centrifugal fan development task. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

Intelligent-based computational design (IBCD) techniques, which integrate computational design techniques and machine learning (ML) algorithms, offer a solution to reduce required testing by providing predictions. This paper proposes a deep learning (DL)-based IBCD method for modeling floats' lift-to-drag coefficient ratio (CL/CD), where DL is one of the most powerful ML. The proposed method consists of two phases: hyper-parameter optimization and DL model training and evaluation. A genetic algorithm (GA) is employed in the first phase to explore complex hyper-parameter combinations efficiently. Evaluation of the predicted CL/CD of the floats using the DL model resulted in a satisfactory R-squared of 0.9329 and the lowest mean squared error (MSE) of 0,001536. These results demonstrate the ability of DL model to predict the float's performance accurately and can facilitate further design optimization. Thus, the proposed method can offer a time-efficient and cost-effective solution for predicting float performance, aiding in optimizing floatplane designs and enhancing their functionalities. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

An ML framework based on five different regression models is formulated to estimate the parameters significant to mission profile using database of fixed-wing UAVs key design attributes. The predictive performance of the presented ML approach shows excellent agreement with the actual values during validation and comparatively, turns out to be more accurate than the existing methodology based on empirical correlations.

To train ML prediction models, comprehensive and structured datasets of historical data are required. This solution is inapplicable when such information is unavailable or sparse due to the lack of structured datasets. For engineered-to-order products, the number of historical records is often limited and strongly influenced by different purchasing or manufacturing strategies, thus requiring complex normalisation of such data. This method overcomes the above limitations by presenting an ML-based cost modelling methodology for the conceptual design that is applicable even when historical data are insufficient to train the prediction algorithms. The training dataset is generated through an analytical and automatic software tool for manufacturing cost estimation. Such a tool, starting from a 3D model of a product, can quickly and autonomously assess the related cost in different scenarios. An extensive and structured training dataset can be easily generated. The proposed methodology was based on CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining). Cost engineers of an Oil \& Gas company used the method to develop parametric cost models for discs and spacers of an axial compressor. The solution guarantees lower error (7\% vs 9\%) and significant time-saving (minutes instead of hours) than estimations based on other approaches. Cost models are more comprehensive (capable of analysing different scenarios), explainable (not conceived as a black box), and self-learning (can be updated by extending the training dataset). © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {In this work we propose a novel deep learning assisted topology optimization model that predicts the final optimization result (which is usually obtained through hundreds of redesign/trial-error iterations) from only a few initial redesign iterations and few fine tuning iterations. The broad idea is to sandwich a deep learning model between the initial redesign iterations and the fine tuning iterations. The deep learning model acts as a surrogate model and allows us to learn the evolution law in an efficient manner. Although the proposed framework can accommodate any deep learning model, we have used the state-of-the-art flow based generative model. The flow based model takes the topological configurations from the initial redesign steps as input and yields the optimal configuration which is then further fine tuned by running the topology optimization algorithm for a few iterations. The final fine tuning topology optimization iteration assures structural soundness and integrity of the optimized configuration. The total computation time of this model is seen to be significantly less than the standard topology optimization routines. The generalization capability of this framework is demonstrated by having promising result in design domains with different boundary and loading conditions (dynamic and multiple point-loads). More interestingly, the proposed model generalizes to nonlinear systems without any retraining. Overall the proposed framework is robust and can be used as an alternative tool in conceptual design optimization process. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In the structural fatigue fields, such as aerospace, maritime, and civil engineering, the accurate construction of the Probability-Stress-Life (P-S-N) curve is crucial for preventing unexpected structural failures and is fundamental to the engineering design process. Conventional methods usually assume that the fatigue life distribution follows a normal or weibull distribution, which overlooks the differences of life distribution at different stress levels and introduces subjective errors. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new approach based a multi-layer perceptron model with maximum entropy algorithm (MPME) for probabilistic fatigue life prediction. During the derivation of life probability distribution function in this approach, the type not require any pre-assumption, thus effectively avoiding the introduction of subjective errors. Specifically, the dispersed information of fatigue life is quantified as various life distribution statistical features such as mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis. Next, learn the continuous functional relationship between stress and these features using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Finally, the target probability distribution is derived using the maximum entropy algorithm, with the predicted distribution features obtained from the MLP serving as constraints for it. In addition, to ensure the consistency between the prediction of MLP and physical laws, we encode physical knowledge into the network loss to guide the updating of network parameters. Experimental results of two different material fatigue data demonstrate that, compared to traditional deterministic model-based methods and machine learning methods, the MPME in this paper can more accurately predict the probabilistic fatigue life. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Specifically, a model of MLP or CNN is limited to structures of a particular topology type and fails immediately when applied to other topology types. In order to tackle this challenge, we propose a scalable performance evaluation method (called FrameGraph) for frame structure designs using graph neural network (GNN), offering applicability to a wide range of topology types simultaneously. FrameGraph consists of two main parts: (1) Components and their connections in a frame structure are denoted as edges and vertices in a graph, respectively. Subsequently, a graph dataset for frame structure designs with different topologies is constructed. (2) A well-defined GNN design space is established with a general GNN layer, and a controlled random search approach is employed to derive the optimal GNN model for this performance evaluation task. In numerical experiments of car door frames and car body frames, FrameGraph achieved the highest prediction precisions (96.28\% and 97.87\%) across all structural topologies compared to a series of classical GNN algorithms. Furthermore, the comparison with MLP and FEM highlighted FrameGraph's significant efficiency advantage. This verifies the feasibility and optimality of FrameGraph for the performance evaluation task of frame structures with different topologies.  © 2024 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Due to the complex structure of the LFR fuel rod bundle, refined CFD simulation consumes significant computing resources and time, making it difficult to meet the immediate needs of engineering design and research. This paper introduces a method that integrates the sub-channel level thermal-hydraulic analysis code CorTAF-LBE with the BPNN algorithm to analyze the thermal-hydraulic phenomena within the LFR core. The method has been validated by refined simulation results of the THEADES test section, which indicate that the error is within an acceptable range. The feasibility of its application in LFR fuel assemblies was also evaluated. The flow characteristics and temperature distribution in unwrapped LFR rod bundles are investigated. Due to differences in fuel distribution and flow area, the temperature in the central channel is much higher than that in the side and trapezoidal channels. Three accident conditions, including inlet blockage, center blockage, and outlet blockage, were simulated. The corresponding peak temperatures of the fuel cladding were 670 K, 767 K, and 860 K, respectively, representing an increase of approximately 170 K compared to the nominal conditions. The analysis results effectively demonstrate the 3D temperature distribution of the fluid in the rod bundles, which is significant for reactor design and safety analysis of LFRs. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS},

	abstract = {Environmental managers attempt to increasingly incorporate precautionary principles into decision making. The literature lacks Machine Learning -based approaches for forewarning lifecycle environmental impacts. This paper proposes a method to support electric vehicle design. The main innovation of the work lays in merging Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Machine Learning foundations to provide support and awareness to designers. The present approach overcomes the present literature because it provides a method for the design phase, is based on a well-established methodology (LCA) and provides quantitative results from little inputs. The approach exploits machine Learning Methods to develop models with the design features of a generic electric vehicle (such as vehicle mass and distance traveled) in six phases (Problem definition; Data collection; Data Preparation; Modeling; Model evaluation; Model interpretation). Differently from existing environmental analyses, all stages of the product life cycle have been considered in building the database; moreover, the model provides quantitative results. Regression models and supervised algorithms were used. The obtained model can be used by product engineers, as well as those not experts on LCA. Moreover, the model guarantees the database and hypothesis's uniqueness, ensuring the results coherence and comparability. The level of accuracy obtained in the case study (error or 17\%) is comparable with studies handling full environmental analysis (that should be more accurate), and outstanding, as the present case is for the design phase. Future works will focus on additional significative indicators, similar electric vehicle design and integration with prospective LCA approaches. © 2024 The Authors},

The study provides contributions to six research aspects. First, we show which machine learning algorithms are appropriate when dealing with product cost estimation for highly complex products with more than 2000 parts and hundreds of cost drivers. Second, our case study provides a novel approach to increasing the predictive accuracy of cost estimates for subsequent product generations. Third, we show that the accuracy is up to 3.5 times higher when using big data compared to an intermediate size of data. Fourth, machine learning can outperform cost estimates from cost experts during the early stage of new product development, even when dealing with highly complex products. Then, we evaluate the use cases, issues, and benefits of machine learning and big data from the perspective of cost experts. Specifically, the case study shows that machine learning can reliably select the most important cost drivers (fifth aspect) and calculate the average cost of cost drivers over thousands of product configurations (sixth aspect). However, cost experts must be knowledgeable about the product and remain careful when interpreting machine learning outcomes, as they can yield misleading outcomes in some exceptional cases. In conclusion, machine learning and big data empirically proved to be able to generate additional value in many aspects for managing costs during the early phase of new product development. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {To tackle the challenging near-wall turbulence modeling while preserving low computational cost, the near-wall nonoverlapping domain decomposition (NDD) method is proposed, incorporating the machine-learning technique. Using recently proposed implicit NDD (INDD), the solution can be calculated with a Robin-type (slip) wall boundary condition on a relatively coarse mesh and then corrected in the near-wall region at every iteration through an estimated turbulent viscosity profile obtained from a neural network. To maintain a reasonable complexity with acceptable accuracy, only the near-wall field properties, i.e., wall-normal distance, near-wall velocities, streamwise pressure gradients, and one near-wall scale parameter, are employed as the input features for the neural network. The benefit of incorporating machine learning is twofold. First, the near-wall turbulent viscosity is predicted more accurately than by the traditional algebraic functions used in the approximate approach. Second, similarly to the conventional NDD, the present simulations save one order of computational cost over the fully resolved one-block simulations. The accuracy and efficiency of the method are demonstrated on test cases with the k-ϵ model, including turbulent flows in a channel and an asymmetric diffuser at different Reynolds numbers. Results compare favorably with the one-block benchmark solutions and show a better agreement when compared with approximate NDD predictions. In the latter case, a variation of diffuser geometry is also considered to test the model performance on engineering design tasks with another turbulent model (i.e., Spalart-Allmaras), showing good generalization capability on different turbulence closures.  © 2024 American Physical Society.},

DMD processes inherently induce residual stresses and distortions in the build part. While finite element (FE) analysis is one of the approaches to predict the residual stress, the high computational time required for the FE analysis makes it undesirable for the early stages of product development. This study extends a previously developed approach to more complex structures to evaluate the accuracy and computational efficiency of predicting residual stresses. For the present study, six different metallic structures with various complex shapes made from AISI 304 L were considered. Comparing the residual stress fields predicted by the integrated ANN-FE with thermomechanical FE analysis, the results demonstrated consistent distributions for all stress components across structures. Although localized regions exhibited higher errors, these areas coincided with low-stress zones, posing no critical concerns. Despite higher errors in some areas, most structures displayed prediction errors below 15\%. Moreover, the analysis achieved a substantial computational efficiency enhancement of approximately 6 times for all structures analyzed. © 2024 The Authors},

ML appears to be an effective, affordable, accurate and scalable technique to cost mechanical parts in the early stage of the design process. Despite the cost estimation methods proposed in the literature, their application in specific real industrial contexts (e.g., engineered-to-order products) is minimal. This paper presents an innovative method for developing ML-based parametric cost models. The training data set is generated thanks to an analytical and automatic software tool for cost estimation. The data is subsequently processed using the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining – CRISP-DM method. CRISP-DM is a process model for data science and representation. It provides an overview of the data mining life cycle. Its flexibility and easy customisation allow the creation of a data mining model that fits the goal of this work. The proposed method was employed to develop two cost models (semi-finishing and finishing phases) for components (disks) of a gas turbine. Gradient Boosted Trees turned out to be the best-performing prediction algorithm. Design engineers successfully used the generated cost models while configuring the gas-turbine cross-section. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

While the path synthesis of planar mechanisms is not a new problem, the effective representation of coupler curves in the context of neural networks has not been fully explored. This study compares four commonly used features or representations of four-bar coupler curves: Fourier descriptors, wavelets, point coordinates, and images. The results demonstrate that these diverse representations can be unified using a generative AI framework called variational autoencoder (VAE). This study shows that a VAE can provide a standalone representation of a coupler curve, regardless of the input representation, and that the compact latent dimensions of the VAE can be used to describe coupler curves of four-bar linkages. Additionally, a new approach that utilizes a VAE in conjunction with a fully connected neural network to generate dimensional parameters of four-bar linkage mechanisms is proposed.

Their integration into structural optimization can enable automated structure- and process-optimized castings. Nevertheless, these simulations are time-consuming and computationally expensive. Therefore, this paper used graph theory and skeletonization techniques to extract geometric features from arbitrary 3D geometries and transferred them to machine learning-metamodels. This method can replace casting process simulation for the prediction of directional solidification in low-pressure die casting. Automated machine learning and hyperparameter optimization were used to systemize the search for well-suited neural network architectures. Two examples were used to train the metamodels, which are subsequently evaluated by a further test example, unknown to the training data and compared to the simulation results. The results showed an accuracy on unknown geometries over 60 \% and thus emphasized that neural network metamodels are capable of replacing time-consuming casting process simulation for specific objectives. © 2023 Elsevier B.V..

	abstract = {New Product Development (NPD) is to stay competitive; it is seen as one of the finest techniques to cope with quick changes in the goods confronting the market. Researchers have adjusted the measurements to become some NPD so that research variables may impact the firm, but they have not attempted to measure. The measuring component is crucial to give proper control over product development operations. It will employ a web-based tool for monitoring the growth of NPD skills in the field area. If the organization has identified an essential mastering function, you may create long-term objectives. To suggest the networks are employed in two phases, the second Neural Network (NN) model output is the value of the capacity level as NPD. Test and train data is utilized to select the NN. One technique to cope with uncertainty and risk in a NPD process is understanding the success of NPD in Critical Success Factors (CSFs). The relationship between the selection of key metrics and the accumulation of factors contributing to success is necessary in order to train a neural network to accurately predict the results of an NPD. Entering the data is acquired by a corporation in the electronics sector. Companies have adopted a new product development process and do not have a new process; however, these items may be changed. The findings suggest that NN technology is strong enough to predict successful NPD in the electronics sector. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing and data analytics are independently flourishing research areas, where the latter can be leveraged to gain a great insight into the former. In this paper, the mechanical responses of additively manufactured samples using vat polymerization process with different weight ratios of magnetic microparticles were used to develop, train, and validate a neural network model. Samples with six different compositions, ranging from neat photopolymer to a composite of photopolymer with 4 wt.\% of magnetic particles, were manufactured and mechanically tested at quasi-static strain rate and ambient environmental conditions. The experimental data were also synthesized using a data-driven approach based on shape-preserving piecewise interpolations while leveraging the concept of simple micromechanics rule of mixture. The overarching objective is to forecast the mechanical behavior of new compositions to eliminate or reduce the need for exhaustive post-manufacturing testing, resulting in an accelerated product development cycle. The ML model predictions were found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental data for prognostication of the mechanical behavior of physically tested samples with near-unity correlation coefficients. Furthermore, the ML model performed reasonably well in predicting the mechanical response of untested, newly formulated compositions of photopolymers and magnetic particles. On the other hand, the data-driven approach predictions suffered from processing artifacts, demonstrating the superiority of ML algorithms in handling this type of data. Overall, this analysis approach holds great potential in advancing the prospects of additive manufacturing and model-less mechanics of material analyses. A byproduct of the ML approach is using the results for quality assurance, accelerating the acceptance of additively manufactured parts into industrial deployments. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Selecting an appropriate set of the initial parameter for the aircraft conceptual design phase has a huge effect on the overall design result of the aircraft. Therefore, estimating appropriate combinations of the initial design parameters is an essential step for obtaining feasible conceptual design results. Existing methods selected the initial parameters by using empirical formulas or adopting the empirical parameters. These methods have limitations in that the design results are highly dependent on the user’s experience and prior knowledge. Moreover, it is necessary to evaluate numerous empirical formulas to figure out the relationships between diverse combinations of variables. To overcome these limitations, this study applied data-driven machine learning techniques. The data-driven approach has advantages since it utilizes large, accumulated data and depends less on the user’s experience. Therefore, data-driven machine learning models are utilized for the estimation of the initial parameters of aircraft conceptual design. Several machine learning models, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), variational autoencoder (VAE), and random forest (RF) are applied. These models are capable of handling incomplete and heterogeneous data. This is a huge advantage because most of the existing aircraft data are incomplete and composed of various data types. An incomplete dataset can be entered so that the model can directly learn from the data. The actual data of the aircrafts that served in World War II is gathered and utilized in this study. kNN, VAE, and RF have distinct learning tactics, so this study set the universal criteria to compare the performances of the three models. Furthermore, unlike other studies that require a complete dataset for training and validation, this study constructed the repeated imputation procedure and successfully assessed both models. As preliminary research, this study presented the validity of applying a data-driven approach to the aircraft initial sizing problem.

	abstract = {An accurate forecast of the final manufacturing costs in the early product development phase is a key element, especially in mechanical engineering. An accurate and reliable prediction allows, on the one hand, estimating the economic feasibility and, on the other hand, deriving necessary cost reductions. It is essential to evaluate and monitor compliance with the cost target initially and throughout the entire development process. Most cost estimation methods are primarily based on simple heuristic and statistical approaches that provide only limited accurate predictions in the early development phase. Sufficiently precise cost estimations, especially for customer-specific developments, are only possible in the late phase of the development process using finely parameterized models and cost rates at the component level. The supporting use of Machine Learning (ML) has not yet played a major role in cost estimation in mechanical engineering. Therefore, this article shows the general applicability of ML for predicting manufacturing costs in mechanical engineering and that even in the early phase of product development, precise predictions with little known information about the final product are possible. In addition, we present a generic feature set for ML-based cost prediction regarding machinery. Furthermore, the quality of different created ML models was evaluated based on real data of a mechanical engineering use case, and high accuracy in predicting manufacturing costs was demonstrated. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Typical algorithms used in optimisation problems can be classified into gradient-based or agent-based optimisers. Gradient-based optimisers boast very fast convergence due to their ability to extract topological information from the local gradient of the objective function, but can often get trapped in a local minimum. Agent-based optimisers use a series of agents to traverse the search space stochastically and are thus much more prone to find the global minimum, but their cost may be unacceptable in typical engineering optimisation problems. The question remains on whether convergence of agent-based algorithms can be accelerated using design space information. A novel optimisation algorithm is introduced that uses machine learning in the form of a Self-Organising Map (SOM) to extract topological information from the optimisation design space and guide the agents of a Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA). The proposed optimiser is benchmarked against a set of unconstrained analytical optimisation functions, and it is shown to outperform classical agent-based optimisers. The algorithm is further applied to an engineering design problem in the form of constrained transonic aerodynamic shape optimisation, confirming its robustness and higher performance. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

Afterwards, existing engineering change data has to be transferred into a data set by use of the description model. The build data set is split into training and test data to identify the prediction quality for unseen engineering change requests. Next, the prediction model is built in python by the aid of Sklearn, NumPy and Pandas. The results of the prediction model are presented and discussed.

	abstract = {The management and controlling of product costs play an important role in the early stages of value creation, since 70 - 80 \% final product costs are determined in product development and design processes. Traditionally, the focus in business practice is often on the organizational controlling unit that records the corresponding costs when they occur. In those, later phases of the product lifecycle, the possibilities of exerting influence are very limited. Consequently, an accurate estimation of costs in the early design phase is an important instrument to support strategic decisions in the product engineering process. An intelligent approach based on machine learning to support cost management in the early design stage is presented. In a real-world case study using wheel cost data from a large original equipment manufacturer (OEM) we investigate the performance of a cross-validated machine learning framework using a greedy sequential forward feature selection method for dimensionality reduction, as well as grid search hyperparameter tuning in order to compare six regression algorithms. The results of the study show that it is possible to predict the costs of product components in the early design phase with an R2 of 0.960 using only seven features coming from the product design and development department. By a cluster analysis and scatter plots of prediction accuracies it is shown where the deviations in cost estimation come from. The study supports the statement that machine learning models are a promising instrument for product managers and cost engineers. © 2021 The Author(s).},

The constraint satisfaction is formulated as a classification problem, where an artificial neural network is employed to predict the corresponding probabilities. Different from existing approaches which require a double loop paradigm for either training or applying the artificial neural networks, the proposed approach is able to give probability prediction for any arbitrary point in the entire design space, using only one loop of model evaluations. As a result, the computational cost is reduced. An illustrative example is used to highlight the differences between the existing and proposed approaches. The usefulness of the latter is further demonstrated with an aircraft sizing case study. The results show that the proposed approach can provide reasonably accurate predictions for a realistic design problem. © 2021 32nd Congress of the International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences, ICAS 2021.

	abstract = {A design support system is developed in this work that can be integrated into the car side silhouette design tools and can estimate the drag coefficient of a given silhouette. This task is typically performed via two manners: namely wind tunnel testing and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Due to the high computational cost for these two approaches, it is impractical to employ them during the silhouette conceptual design stage in a real time. Therefore, a mathematical model is obtained in this study for the drag coefficient estimation of a given silhouette. First, the desired number of silhouettes are generated via a generative design (silhouette sampling) technique so that the silhouettes are evenly distributed in the silhouette design space. Each silhouette is then tested via computational fluid dynamics simulations, and their corresponding drag coefficients (C                             D                             s) are obtained. A training dataset is formed with the silhouette geometries and C                             D                             s of the silhouettes, and a mathematical model that can estimate the drag coefficient (C                             D                             ) of a silhouette is finally obtained via principal component analysis (PCA) followed by regression/neural network methods. These three steps are repeated until a desired level of reliable mathematical model is obtained.

The critical success factors for new product development are identified on the basis of information acquired from an enterprise system, including the fields of sales and marketing, project management, and production. The model of new product screening consists of enterprise functional domains and business information systems. The model has been described in terms of a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) that contains a set of decision variables, their domains, and the constraints. Knowledge base is specified according to CSP framework and it reflects the company’s resources and relationships identified. The illustrative example presents the use of fuzzy neural network to estimating the success of new products and constraint programming to product concept screening in the context of the different search strategies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

The function-behaviour-structure framework is adopted in this stage to help designers search design space and generate conceptual solutions iteratively. Computer-aided methods developed within this framework will yield significant insight into facilitating the cognitive activities of designers. In order to solve the mapping process from behaviours to structures which is a typical constraint satisfaction problem, a cerebellar operant conditioning-inspired constraint satisfaction approach is proposed in this paper. The design constraints-driven operant conditioning and its regulation mechanism by the cerebellum are analysed for the first time. Proposition logic is applied to transfer the constraint satisfaction problem into a propositional satisfiability problem while an undirected graph is utilised to model design space. Inspired by the modularised cerebellar structure, a modularised constraint satisfaction neural network is constructed to determine the satisfiability of design problems. Conceptual solutions can be generated by clustering the embedding of nodes in this network. The proposed approach imitates the design constraint-driven operant conditioning to narrow down design space without assigning specific values to design components. It reduces design iterations and avoids combinatorial explosions during conceptual design.},

We introduce a design of crease section in the proposed reconfigurable structure, which undergoes enormous and complicated deformation in the folding and unfolding process. Although this crease design can make the deploying process more straightforward, it can jeopardize the stability and life cycle of the structure. We explore how the geometric parameters of the design affect the stability and fatigue failure, including length ratio, total height, story's height, thickness, crease indexes, and circumscribed circle's radius. In order to reduce the computational time, we develop an ANN employing the obtained Finite Element method (FEM) results. The ANN results demonstrate that decreasing the circumscribed circle's radius, the length ratio, and the total height enhance the stability of the origami-inspired structure. It is found that crease indexes affect stability based on the radius of the circumscribed circle. In addition, we investigate how these parameters simultaneously contribute to this design's buckling load and life cycle. The results provide a detailed design parameter characteristic map that can be used to optimize origami structure performance. © 2022},

However, gaps such as the low prediction accuracy of ANN with small training data and inefficiency of data generation are still unaddressed. In this paper, for investigation of the variation of the maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of hypersonic vehicles as the configuration changes, a method combing physics-informed neural network (PINN) and knowledge based engineering (KBE) is developed to study the issue. In this method, PINN is used as the predictor of MTOW, the prior knowledge of engineers is able to be embedded into the loss function and guide the training of PINN. Compared with that of traditional neural network, the prediction accuracy of PINN is higher especially with small training data. Moreover, the KBE is used to guide the design process of generating training data and the efficiency of data generation can be improved. In order to account for the validity of the proposed method, the MTOW prediction of hypersonic vehicles with different wing configurations has been investigated.

	abstract = {With the development of the controllable suspension systems, the mono-tube hydraulic adjustable damper has attracted great public attention with the advantages such as good heat dissipation, less power, fast response, durable, reliable, and simple structure. However, the unknown regulating mechanism modeling impedes the practical application of the mono-tube hydraulic adjustable damper. To model the regulating mechanism, this paper analytically studies the behavior of the mono-tube hydraulic adjustable damper via developing an analytical model and thermal effect equations for the use of engineering design. Then, the mono-tube hydraulic adjustable damper is tested in an integral shock absorber testing system to verify the accuracy of model and equations. On the basis of the verified analytical model and thermal effect equations, a compensation system with gray neural network algorithm is originally designed to model the regulating mechanism of the mono-tube hydraulic adjustable damper, thus achieving the desired damping force adaptively and accurately at various working conditions by obtaining the required rotary angle of the adjustment rod. The simulation results and experimental results show that the characteristic analyses of mono-tube hydraulic adjustable damper are reliable. Meanwhile, the simulation results of the gray neural network algorithm also indicate that the proposed compensation system can provide an exact regulating mechanism model for the mono-tube hydraulic adjustable damper and the proposed gray neural network algorithm is superior to the traditional neural network algorithm. © IMechE 2018.},

	abstract = {Designing mechatronic systems is known to be a very complex and tedious process due to the high number of system components, their multi-physical aspects, the couplings between the different domains involved in the product, and the interacting design objectives. This inherent complexity calls for the crucial need of a systematic and multi-objective design thinking methodology to replace the often-used sequential design approach that tends to deal with the different domains and their corresponding design objectives separately leading to functional but not necessarily optimal designs. Thus, a new approach based on a multi-criteria profile for mechatronic systems is presented in this paper for the conceptual design stage. Additionally, to facilitate fitting the intuitive requirements for decision-making in the presence of interacting criteria, three different methods are proposed and compared using a case study of designing a vision-guided quadrotor drone system. These methods benefit from three different aggregation techniques such as Choquet integral, Sugeno integral and fuzzy-based neural network. To validate the decision yielded by the results of global concept score for each aggregation methods, a computer simulation of a visual servoing system on all design alternatives for quadrotor drone has been performed. It is shown that although the Sugeno fuzzy can be a useful aggregation function for decisions under uncertainty, but the approaches using Choquet fuzzy and fuzzy integral-based neural network seem to be more precise and reliable in a multi-criteria design problem where interaction between the objectives cannot be overlooked. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Increasingly complex engineering design challenges requires the diversification of knowledge required on design teams. In the context of open innovation, positioning key members within these teams or groups based on their estimated abilities leads to more impactful results since mass collaboration is fundamentally a sociotechnical system. Determining how each individual influences the overall design process requires an understanding of the predicted mapping between their technical competency and performance. This work explores this relationship through the use of predictive models composed of various algorithms. With support of a dataset composed of documents related to the design performance of students working on their capstone design project in combination with textual descriptors representing individual technical aptitudes, correlations are explored as a method to predict overall project development performance. Each technical competency and project is represented as a distribution of topic knowledge to produce the performance metrics, which are referred to as topic competencies, since topic representations increase the ability to decompose and identify human-centric performance measures. Three methods of topic identification and five prediction models are compared based on their prediction accuracy. From this analysis, it is found that representing input variables as topics distributions and the resulting performance as a single indicator while using support vector regression provided the most accurate mapping between ability and performance. With these findings, complex open innovation projects will benefit from increased knowledge of individual ability and how that correlates to their predicted performances. Copyright © 2020 by ASME.},

The main objective is to integrate the prediction of the subjective comfort evaluation into the concept phase of product development process. By means of the human sensation model based on the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), the subjectively sensed convenience of each passenger is estimated. In this paper, two examples of the implementation of the proposed methods are discussed. The first example represents an investigation of comfort-relevant design parameters of the drive train, such as the friction coefficient gradient of the clutch friction pair, the mass of inertia and the damping of the dual mass flywheel. The consequent vibrational properties and the subjective assessments during the start-up situation are predicted. The second example considers the determination of gear rattle tendency of a 5-speed manual transmission. To predict the gear rattle presence and to evaluate the resulted annoying level, the ANN-based models representing the NVH experts are elaborated. As a result, a good correlation of the subjective ratings and the predicted evaluations is attained. Consequently, the proposed method can be effectively applied to compare different gearbox solutions for new product concept. Hence, the development time and costs might be significantly reduced. © 2015, The Korean Society of Automotive Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The use of product families allows firms to meet these needs in a cost-competitive manner. The determination of which components to share and which should be unique is very important to the development of product families. Commonality metrics are presented with the goal of assessing (at the early stages of development) the ability of the product family to reduce costs. The methodology of process-based cost modeling is used to project product development, fabrication, and assembly costs in both the standalone and shared situations. A case study of two automotive instrument panel beams is analyzed. Linear-regression analysis shows that when compared to total cost savings, a simple piece commonality metric and a fabrication-investment-weighted metric have higher R2 than a mass- or piece-cost-weighted metric. When correlated to fixed cost savings, the fabrication-investment-weighted metric has the highest R2 (0.62) and is significant at the 0.025 level. Fixed cost savings are proposed as the desired quantity when assessing product family efficiency. © 2006 IEEE.},

In addition, another artificial neural network estimation approach with a single back-propagation network, called FAPSO-SBP, is also established. To verify the proposed FAPSO-TBP approach, comparisons with the FAPSO-SBP and general back-propagation artificial neural network (GBP) are made.

	abstract = {Design optimization of structural systems is often iterative, time consuming and is limited by the knowledge of the designer. For that reason, a rapid design optimization scheme is desirable to avoid such problems. This paper presents and integrates two design methodologies for efficient conceptual design of structural systems involving computationally intensive analysis. The first design methodology used in this paper is structural modification technique (SMT). The SMT utilizes the frequency response functions (FRFs) of the original model for the reanalysis of the structure that is subjected to structural modification. The receptances of the original structure are coupled with the dynamic stiffness of the components that are added to or removed from the original structure to perform the structural modification. Then, the coupled matrices are used to calculate the mobility matrices of the modified structure in an efficient way. The second design methodology used in this paper is neural networks (NN). Once sufficient input and output relationships are obtained through SMT, a NN model is constructed to predict the FRF curves of the system for further analysis of the system performance while experimenting different design parameters. The input-output sets used for training the network are increased by applying an interpolation scheme to improve the accuracy of the NN model. The performance of the proposed method integrated through SMT and NN technique is demonstrated on a rectangular plate to observe the effect of the location and thickness of stiffeners on the frequency response of the structure. It is observed that both methods combined with the proposed interpolation scheme work very efficiently to predict the dynamic response of the structure when modifications are required to improve the system performance. © 2013 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

Sorting techniques, picture sorts in particular, have been employed for customer requirements acquisition during product redesign process. By applying such a systematic knowledge or requirements acquisition technique, some objectives and constraints of product redesign can then be identified. Furthermore, it has become an imperative to quantitatively and automatically analyze the elicited customer requirements so as to simplify and optimize the subsequent product conceptualization and selection of conceptual design alternatives. For this purpose, the adaptive resonance theory, especially ART2, neural network has been utilized for the preliminary design decisions, such as customer segmentation, in terms of customer requirements evaluation.

	abstract = {Product family design and platform-based product development have garnered much attention over the last decade. They have been used to provide nearly customized products to satisfy individual customer requirements and simultaneously achieve economies of scale during production. The inherent challenge in product family design is to balance the tradeoff between product commonality (how well the components and functions can be reused across a product family) and variety (the range of different products in a product family). Quantifying this tradeoff at the product family planning stage, in a way that supports the engineering design process, has yet to be accomplished. Responding to this need, we have developed a graphical evaluation method, the Product Family Evaluation Graph (PFEG), that allows designers to choose the 'best' product family design option among sets of alternatives based on their performance with respect to the ideal commonality/variety trade off, given a company's competitive focus. One of the necessary supporting pieces for the PFEG is to develop a quantitative representation of the ideal tradeoff between commonality and variety in a product family based on the elements that characterize a company's competitive focus. In this paper, we develop the commonality/variety tradeoff angle, α, ranging from 0° to 90°, as a quantitative representation of the ideal commonality/variety tradeoff in product families based on a company's competitive focus and their industry-wide competitors' information. α is defined as a function of the weighted sum of the strategic factors' quantitative impact on commonality and variety (S) in a product family. These factors cover five categories - market, product characteristics, life-cycle processes, government and industry regulations and/or standards, and organizational capabilities. In this paper, we analyze whether each of these factors causes an increase or decrease in commonality or variety to better understand their impacts. The factors and their categories are admittedly incomplete and the analyses of the factors' impact are subjective. A more accurate factor identification and impact analysis will be necessary in the near future as the number of companies using the product family strategy increase. We intend for this paper to serve as a basis for that expansion. In this paper, we propose a three-step approach to estimate this angle for a given company using the linear regression model. The angle can then be used with the PFEG to help designers evaluate a product family or compare product family design alternatives. The proposed angle is illustrated with an application to four families of power tools.},

	abstract = {In the traditional metal-formed product development paradigm, the design of metal-formed product and tooling is usually based on heuristic know-how and experiences, which are generally obtained through long years of apprenticeship and skilled craftsmanship. The uncertainties in product and tooling design often lead to late design changes. The emergence of finite element method (FEM) provides a solution to verify the designs before they are physically implemented. Since the design of product and tooling is affected by many factors and there are many design variables to be considered, the combination of those variables comes out with various design alternatives. It is thus not pragmatic to simulate all the designs to find out the best solution as the coupled simulation of non-linear plastic flow of billet material and tooling deformation is very time-consuming. This research is aimed to develop an integrated methodology based on FEM simulation and artificial neural network (ANN) to approximate the functions of design parameters and evaluate the performance of designs in such a way that the optimal design can be identified. To realize this objective, an integrated FEM and ANN methodology is developed. In this methodology, the FEM simulation is first used to create training cases for the ANN(s), and the well-trained ANN(s) is used to predict the performance of the design. In addition, the methodology framework and implementation procedure are presented. To validate the developed technique, a case study is employed. The results show that the developed methodology performs well in estimation and evaluation of the design. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Consequently, enterprises seeking to develop new products are now obliged to place an ever-increasing emphasis on a product's apparent style, i.e. its color and form. However, conventional numerical approaches are limited in their ability to ascertain an individual's psychological reaction to a particular product style. A mutual dependency exists between a product's form and its color when considering the overall image sensation of the product. Accordingly, a quantitative evaluation method using gray theory for the CIE color planning stage of product design is proposed in this paper. Subsequently, this paper further develops an approach to evaluate the integrated image of a multi-colored product form based on the theorems of fuzzy neural networks and gray theory. Two case studies are taken to demonstrate the effectiveness of the image evaluation approaches for the product color design and the multi-colored form design.},

	abstract = {Life cycle concerns have been considered as a major issue of increasing importance. Recently, companies have realized that both environmental and economic aspects have become a more competitive issue. This environmental and economic performance of a product includes all life cycle phases, from raw material extraction to end-of-life treatment. Life-cycle cost (LCC) has been considered to enable a comprehensive cost analysis to be carried out to improve economic performance, but this method is usually time and cost consuming. Therefore, there is a need for easy-to-use and approximate methods to support cost-effective decision making in early product development. In order to incorporate LCC into early product development, an approximate method for the estimation of maintenance cost as one component of LCC is proposed. This method allows the designer to make a comparative estimation of maintenance cost for design alternatives by considering high-level product attributes and the maintenance cost during the life cycle of products. To estimate the maintenance cost, the identified product attributes are used as inputs and the calculated maintenance cost is used as outputs in a learning algorithm based on artificial neural networks. The proposed approach does not replace the detailed cost estimation but it would give some cost-effective guidelines of products during the life cycle and create possibly new maintenance concepts.},

	abstract = {Presented in this paper are the prerequisite steps in a methodology for the identification and assessment of unit cost drivers for use in the development of a new design-oriented unit cost estimation methodology for large commercial jet aircraft with minimum seating capacity of 100 passengers. The work presented here focuses on unit cost, which is a significant element of the total aircraft cost and for the initial aircraft design process in particular. The methodology aims to investigate how aircraft design properties could influence cost. Cost estimation relationships, containing a wide range of the most highly correlated parameters, are retrieved from detailed regression analysis conducted on two different aircraft generation categories. Since the methodology is based on actual cost and technical data, it is accurate both in terms of predicting the aircraft unit cost or conducting cost-comparative studies between different aircraft concepts. The emphasis in this paper is mainly on the development approach and parameter assessments, adopted towards the final unit cost estimation methodology.},

	abstract = {Although significant advances have been made in mechanism synthesis to find a mechanism generating a desired motion at its end-effector, no available synthesis methods can determine the topology of a mechanism and its end-effector location simultaneously. It is generally difficult to pre-determine the location of the end-effector relative to the input drive link because the mechanism synthesis may fail if the end-effector location is incorrectly selected. Therefore, the simultaneous determination of the mechanism topology and its end-effector location can be critically useful to advance automated mechanism synthesis. Motivated by this, we propose a neural network-based big data approach to achieve the simultaneous determination. To implement a big data approach which requires a training dataset consisting of diverse mechanisms of different topologies, we propose the use of a spring-connected rigid block model as a unified means to be able to represent diverse mechanisms. The big data approach is followed by gradient-based shape optimization to determine the detailed dimensions of the mechanism synthesized by the approach. The effectiveness and validity of the proposed method are checked with various mechanism synthesis problems.},
