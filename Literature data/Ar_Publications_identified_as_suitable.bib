	abstract = {In the big data era, firms are inundated with customer data, which are valuable in improving services, developing new products, and identifying new markets. However, it is not clear how companies apply data-driven methods to facilitate customer knowledge management when developing innovative new products. Studies have investigated the specific benefits of applying data-driven methods in customer knowledge management, but failed to systematically investigate the specific mechanics of how firms realised these benefits. Accordingly, this study proposes a systematic approach to link customer knowledge with innovative product development in a data-driven environment. To mine customer needs, this study adopts the Apriori algorithm and C5.0 in addition to the association rule and decision tree methodologies for data mining. It provides a systematic and effective method for managers to extract knowledge 'from' and 'about' customers to identify their preferences, enabling firms to develop the right products and gain competitive advantages. The findings indicate that the knowledge-based approach is effective, and the knowledge extracted is shown as a set of rules that can be used to identify useful patterns for both innovative product development and marketing strategies.},

	abstract = {Many enterprises have been devoting a significant portion of their budget to product development in order to distinguish their products from those of their competitors and to make them better fit the needs and wants of customers. Hence, businesses should develop product designing that could satisfy the customers' requirements since this will increase the enterprise's competitiveness and it is an essential criterion to earning higher loyalties and profits. This paper investigates the following research issues in the development of new digital camera products: (1) What exactly are the customers' "needs" and "wants" for digital camera products? (2) What features is more importance than others? (3) Can product design and planning for product lines/product collection be integrated with the knowledge of customers? (4) How can the rules help us to make a strategy during we design new digital camera? To investigate these research issues, the Apriori and C5.0 algorithms are methodologies of association rules and decision trees for data mining, which is implemented to mine customer's needs. Knowledge extracted from data mining results is illustrated as knowledge patterns and rules on a product map in order to propose possible suggestions and solutions for product design and marketing.

	abstract = {Quality function deployment (QFD) is a proven useful methodology in new product development to satisfy customer requirements (CRs). House of quality (HoQ), the general implementing mode of QFD, is aimed to identify the variables of engineering characteristics (ECs) based on the relationships between CRs and ECs. Traditionally, the establishment of these relationships is mainly dependent on the designers' experience and then the HoQ included many items difficult to handle. For aiding the designers on the HoQ analysis, the paper proposes an Apriori-based data mining approach to extract knowledge from historical data. The approach is mainly focused on mining potential useful association rules (including positive and negative rules) that reflect the relationships according to three objectives: support, confidence, and interestingness. For ensuring the availability and conciseness of these extracted rules, the definitions and calculations of rule conflict and redundancy are proposed and processing procedures are also developed to unite or delete unnecessary rules. The reserved rules are clustered in order to facilitate rule management and reuse. Furthermore, a reuse procedure is also developed for new HoQ analysis. Computational experiments of an electrically powered bicycle are used to illustrate the proposed approach and its capability of extracting useful knowledge.},

Outside of physics, a spectrum is a condition that is not limited to a specific set of values but can vary infinitely within a continuum. In commerce, an effective visualization tool, especially for stakeholders or managers, is a brand spectrum diagram highlighting where the company's brands and products are situated compared to other competitors. This paper investigates the research issues on product and brand spectrum in the beverage product market of Taiwan, which proposes using the Apriori algorithm of association rules, and clustering analysis based on an ontology-based data mining approach, for mining customer and product knowledge from the database.

	abstract = {During the design process, designers must satisfy customer needs while adequately developing engineering objectives. Among these engineering objectives, human considerations such as user interactions, safety, and comfort are indispensable during the design process. Nevertheless, traditional design engineering methodologies have significant limitations incorporating and understanding physical user interactions during early design phases. For example, Human Factors methods use checklists and guidelines applied to virtual or physical prototypes at later design stages to evaluate the concept. As a result, designers struggle to identify design deficiencies and potential failure modes caused by user-system interactions without relying on the use of detailed and costly prototypes. The Function-Human Error Design Method (FHEDM) is a novel approach to assess physical interactions during the early design stage using a functional basis approach. By applying FHEDM, designers can identify user interactions required to complete the functions of the system and to distinguish failure modes associated with such interactions, by establishing user-system associations using the information of the functional model. In this paper, we explore the use of data mining techniques to develop relationships between component, functions, flows and user interactions. We extract design information about components, functions, flows, and user interactions from a set of distinct coffee makers found in the Design Repository to build associations rules. Later, using a functional model of an electric kettle, we compared the functions, flows, and user interactions associations generated from data mining against the associations created by the authors, using the FHEDM. The results show notable similarities between the associations built from data mining and the FHEDM. We are suggesting that design information from a rich dataset can be used to extract association rules between functions, flows, components, and user interactions. This work will contribute to the design community by automating the identification of user interactions from a functional model.},

	abstract = {All kinds of information technologies have been converging rapidly in recent few years from simple traditional computers to diversified multimedia information appliances, creating unprecedented technologies and devices, such as personal digital assistants (PDAs), smart cell phones, portable media players (PMPs), online console games, and set top boxes, among others. These electronic functionalities converged devices with powerful contents and functions, such as the World Wide Web, videoconferencing, e-mail, internet telephony, online gaming, digital television, and net banking, are easier to use than traditional computers but not less capable of performing daily tasks. These information technology revolutions along with rapid growing of network technology not only increased the amount of internet applications and digital contents, but also led to diversified consumer behaviors, increased competition, and opportunities. On the other hand, one-to-one marketing is different from traditional marketing methods because it focuses on customer satisfaction and is customer-oriented rather than focusing on marketing mass consumers; thus a one-to-one marketer tries to find more different products and services for the same customer. Therefore, how to establish potential cross-selling and one-to-one offers through product mix analysis, enhance relationship with customers by means of personalized offers through product knowledge, and understand users' needs and making useful suggestions for new product developments and one-to-one marketing become critical issues to information appliance firms. This paper proposes association rules, clustering analysis and CART as methodologies of data-mining, which is implemented for mining product and marketing knowledge from information users. Knowledge extraction from information users is illustrated as knowledge patterns, rules, clusters, and trees in order to propose suggestions on one-to-one marketing for information appliance firms.

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) assisted by a digital twin is expected to revolutionize the realization of high-value and high-complexity functional parts on a global scale. Machine learning (ML) introduced in digitized AM provides potential to transform AM data into knowledge continuously and automatically; hence AM products will be designed and manufactured with improved quality. Conventional product development systems, however, fail to fully adopt ML algorithms on the increasingly available AM data for knowledge acquisition. To address the limitation, this paper proposes an algorithmic framework for constructing AM knowledge automatically and continuously from data. The proposed algorithm develops predictive models to correlate process parameters with part structure and properties using ML algorithms on design, process control, in-situ monitoring, and ex-situ measurement AM data. Based on the predictive models, the algorithm constructs prescriptive rules necessary for decision-making in AM product developments. The constructed rule knowledge is stored in a knowledge base by the algorithm for further AM knowledge query and constructions. Then, the algorithm provides feedback to a knowledge-query formulation phase, which forms the algorithm into a closed loop. Through the algorithm, AM knowledge can self-evolve continuously, while reflecting dynamically generated AM data in an automated and autonomous manner. A case study is presented to illustrate the proposed algorithm and a software prototype is developed to demonstrate the algorithm capability. © 2019 IEEE.},

An example of such hidden patterns would be the cutting tool which is typically used to produce a profiling feature in a given steel part. Discovering and interpreting such patterns would be useful in supporting and optimizing the operations and planning activities such as process planning and manufacturing systems synthesis. A novel knowledge discovery model is introduced to extract useful correlations between the manufacturing domain and design domain based on historical manufacturing data. An Integer Programming model is developed, for the first time, to extract association rules between sets of various product features and manufacturing capabilities used in their production. These associations identify the specific manufacturing system capabilities associated with (i.e. typically used for) the production of each product feature. The discovered knowledge is then used to synthesize the required manufacturing system capabilities for new products with new combinations of features. The proposed IP model was demonstrated using a case study of seven instances of machined parts and the corresponding milling machines used to produce them. The advantages of the proposed association rule discovery IP model were also demonstrated by comparing it with existing association rule discovery methods. The proposed model is simple and easy to implement and automate. Utilizing the proposed model in manufacturing system synthesis should greatly assist in speeding-up product development and manufacturing systems design and re-design. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Since the first release of Apple iPad in April 2010, tablet computers (or simply tablets) can be viewed as a new category of technological products for general consumers. To compete in the evolving market, it is expected that the manufacturers need to customize the design of tablets to satisfy different needs of customers. To support product customization in this context, one specific challenge is that the customer information of tablets is relatively limited due to the newness of the product category. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a data mining approach to analyze the online reviews that contain customer opinions towards tablet products. In this research, tablet usages are first classified according to three user types: personal, business and student. From the online reviews, association rule mining is applied to investigate what tablet attributes are desired by specific user types. To examine the approach, the online reviews were collected from the time between April 2010 (first release of Apple iPad) and May 2011. Then, the association rule results from that time are compared with the recent tablet products on the market. It is demonstrated that online reviews as the original customer information can provide relevant insights for product customization. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

To show the feasibility of the proposed PDM database, this study integrates a prototype PDM system with on-line analytical processing (OLAP) tools and a data mining module for ECA. It also applies the implemented tools to two typical ECA applications, EC evaluation and EC propagation problems.

This phenomenon is called "feature fatigue". Thus it is imperative to analyze product usability in product definition stage. However, most traditional methods of usability evaluation are generally carried out using prototypes which are not available until in the later stage of product development. This paper proposes an approach based on Web mining to analyze product usability. This approach uses the massive online customer reviews on analogous products and features as data source, which are easy to get from Web and can reflect the most updated customer opinions on product usability. Association rule mining techniques are adopted to extract customer opinions on the usability of product features. The Apriori algorithm is used for mining association rules, based on which a usability evaluation method is then presented. A case example is given to validate the proposed approach. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In fact, retailing is actually the last step in a supply chain that may stretch from Europe or Asia to the customer's hometown. Therefore, any firm that sells a product or provides a service to the final consumer is performing the retailing function. On the other hand, product line extension, which adds depth to an existing product line by introducing new products in the same product category, can give customers greater choice and help to protect the firm from flanking attack by a competitor. In addition, a product line extension is marketed under the same general brand as a previous item or items. Thus, to distinguish the brand extension from the other item(s) under the primary brand, the retailer can either add secondary brand identification or add a generic brand. This paper investigates product line and brand extension issues in the Taiwan branch of a leading international retailing company, Carrefour, which is a hypermarket retailer.

Some of these developments are implemented in customized service to develop customer relationship. Customized service is actually crucial in retail markets. Marketing managers can develop long-term and pleasant relationships with customers if they can detect and predict changes in customer behavior. In the dynamic retail market, understanding changes in customer behavior can help managers to establish effective promotion campaigns. This study integrates customer behavioral variables, demographic variables, and transaction database to establish a method of mining changes in customer behavior. For mining change patterns, two extended measures of similarity and unexpectedness are designed to analyze the degree of resemblance between patterns at different time periods. The proposed approach for mining changes in customer behavior can assist managers in developing better marketing strategies. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A product family is a group of related products based on a product platform, facilitating mass customization by providing a variety of products for different market segments cost-effectively. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying a platform along with variant and unique modules in a product family using data mining techniques. Association rule mining is applied to develop rules related to design knowledge based on product function, which can be clustered by their similarity based on functional features. Fuzzy c-means clustering is used to determine initial clusters that represent modules. The clustering result identifies the platform and its modules by a platform level membership function and classification. We apply the proposed method to determine a new platform using a case study involving a power tool family. Copyright © 2006 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Modern manufacturing systems equipped with computerized data logging systems collect large volumes of data in real time. The data may contain valuable information for operation and control strategies as well as providing knowledge of normal and abnormal operational patterns. Knowledge discovery in databases can be applied to these data to unearth hidden, unknown, representable, and ultimately useful knowledge. Data mining offers tools for discovery of patterns, associations, changes, anomalies, rules, and statistically significant structures and events in data. Extraction of previously unknown, meaningful information from manufacturing databases provides knowledge that may benefit many application areas within the enterprise, for example improving design or fine tuning production processes. This paper examines the application of association rules to manufacturing databases to extract useful information about a manufacturing system's capabilities and its constraints. The quality of each identified rule is tested and, from numerous rules, only those that are statistically very strong and contain substantial design information are selected. The final set of extracted rules contains very interesting information relating to the geometry of the product and also indicates where limitations exist for improvement of the manufacturing processes involved in the production of complex geometric shapes.},

	abstract = {It has been well recognized that product portfolio planning has far-reaching impact on the company's business success in competition. In general, product portfolio planning involves two main stages, namely portfolio identification and portfolio evaluation and selection. The former aims to capture and understand customer needs effectively and accordingly to transform them into specifications of product offerings. The latter concerns how to determine an optimal configuration of these identified offerings with the objective of achieving best profit performance. Current research and industrial practice have mainly focused on the economic justification of a given product portfolio, whereas the portfolio identification issue has been received only limited attention. This article intends to develop explicit decision support to improve product portfolio identification by efficient knowledge discovery from past sales and product records. As one of the important applications of data mining, association rule mining lends itself to the discovery of useful patterns associated with requirement analysis enacted among customers, marketing folks, and designers. An association rule mining system (ARMS) is proposed for effective product portfolio identification. Based on a scrutiny into the product definition process, the article studies the fundamental issues underlying product portfolio identification. The ARMS differentiates the customer needs from functional requirements involved in the respective customer and functional domains. Product portfolio identification entails the identification of functional requirement clusters in conjunction with the mappings from customer needs to these clusters. While clusters of functional requirements are identified based on fuzzy clustering analysis, the mapping mechanism between the customer and functional domains is incarnated in association rules. The ARMS architecture and implementation issues are discussed in detail. An application of the proposed methodology and system in a consumer electronics company to generate a vibration motor portfolio for mobile phones is also presented.},

Current online configuration systems are unable to efficiently identify real customer affective needs because they offer an excess variety of products that usually confuse customers. On the other hand, mining affective customer needs may result in recommender systems, which can enhance existing configuration systems by recommending initial configurations according to customer affective needs. This paper introduces a mass customization recommender system that exploits data mining techniques on automotive industry customer data aiming at revealing associations between user affective needs and the design parameters of automotive products. One key novelty of the presented approach is that it deploys the Citarasa engineering, a methodology that focuses on the provision of the appropriate characterizations on customer data in order to associate them with customer affective needs. Based on the application of classification techniques we build a recommendation engine, which is evaluated in terms of user satisfaction, tool’s effectiveness, usefulness and reliability among other parameters.},

This research presents a novel, data mining approach to forming generic bills of materials (GBOMs), entities that represent the different variants in a product family and facilitate the search for similar designs and configuration of new variants. The technical difficulties include: (i) developing families or categories for products, assemblies, and component parts; (ii) generalizing purchased parts and quantifying their similarity; (iii) performing tree union; and (iv) establishing design constraints. These challenges are met through data mining methods such as text and tree mining, a new tree union procedure, and embodying the GBOM and design constraints in constrained XML. The paper concludes with a case study, using data from a manufacturer of nurse call devices, and identifies a new research direction for data mining motivated by the domains of engineering design and information.},

Several technologies have emerged for the management of agile supply chains. But most of them are in development stages. No common method exists for evaluating agility in supply chains by both researchers and practitioners. The complex manufacturing systems necessitate the validation of innovative solutions using advanced managerial tools and techniques. The manufacturing paradigms have to be evaluated according to their short term action and long term benefits. This article reports the utilisation of fuzzy association rules mining (FARM) approach which enables the decision makers to make flexible decisions for evaluating agility in supply chains in the presence of attributes such as flexibility, profitability, quality, innovativeness, pro-activity, speed of response, cost and robustness. The approach has been applied in an Indian electronic switches manufacturing organisation. The experiences of the conduct of this research indicate that agility evaluation can be performed without constraints by the decision makers.

The core Kansei needs that have a great impact on customers' satisfaction is extracted in RST. FARM can identify the potential relationship between key Kansei attributes and product design attributes. The upright exercise bike is taken as the target case. It is found that the core customer needs of the exercise bike are "vitality", "speed", "luxury" and "stable"; while the "modern" which has no impact on emotional properties is deleted. Finally, the mapping relationship between the "vitality" Kansei image and the shape element is given priority.

	abstract = {Product-service system (PSS) conceptual design process plays a critical and strategic rule in offering an optimal set of products and services to customers. Parameter translation driven by customer requirements (CRs) is the mainline in this process. A two-phase parameter translating process is presented based on a three-domain PSS conceptual design framework: translating CRs into design requirements (DRs), and then into module characteristics (MCs) of products and services. DRs and MCs of PSS are both divided into product-related part and service-related part. There exist complex relationships between and within the two parts of parameters in one domain and those between parameters in two adjacent domains. This condition increases the complexity and difficulty to translate CRs into DRs and MCs with definite specifications. The traditional parameter translating methods which depend on the designers' experiences are insufficient to fulfill the goal of domain mapping. The wealthy conceptual design cases for existing PSS can be reused to generate sufficient knowledge for designers. An apriori-based association rule mining algorithm is proposed to elicit parameter translating rules for aiding the PSS conceptual design. To ensure the availability of the mined rules, rule redundancy and conflicting solutions are taken into account. Considering the new design data are continuously added in, an incremental updating technique is proposed to maintain the association rules without retracing the original database. A weighting strategy is adopted to highlight the novelty the newly added records, and a competitive strategy is employed to avoid ignoring some promising rules. A case study is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach for aiding PSS conceptual design.},

Recognizing this importance of technologies in product development and in response to the lack of investigation, this study proposes an approach based on association rule mining to identify mapping relationships between functions and technologies. Such mapping relationships not only help firms effectively decide on technologies and the corresponding details but also enable them to reuse proven knowledge about functions and technologies. A case study of microlithography machines is reported to demonstrate how the proposed approach identifies mapping relationships from given function and technology data and how these relationships help select technologies and determine details.},

This paper focuses on creating guidelines that are applicable during the early stages of designing universal products. Actionfunction diagrams are used to formally compare existing universal products to their typical counterparts to study the similarities and differences. A data mining technique, particularly association rule learning, generates rules from the universal and typical product comparison data. Generation of function-based association rules for universal design has been performed on a smaller scale using this method; this research seeks to extend and formalize the same method by studying a larger set of universal products. Trends in the generation of rules are analyzed indicating that a finite set of rules should be applicable to an arbitrarily large set of products. Further, the rules are analyzed in detail to evaluate their potential for transferability and reuse from one product to another. Of particular interest is the transferability of the rules across apparently disparate product domains such as garden tools and residential furniture. The conceptual and physical similarity of the rules is discussed in the context of creating universal product families based on a platform of accessible elements.},

	abstract = {Conceptual design evaluation is a significant challenge in product development to select suitable conceptual schemes (CS). Relying on decision makers' (DMs) personal experience for design information may result in incomplete and ambiguous evaluation semantics, creating an incomplete decision matrix. Previous approaches use attributes based on candidate schemes to complete the missing information, but neglect the mining of associated design information from external resources such as patents, reducing the beliefs objectivity after missing semantic completion. Besides, non-compensatory nature between DMs' interactivity and criteria have not been well considered. To fill these issues, a patent text-based CS decision approach considering the fusion of incomplete semantics and scheme beliefs is proposed. First, using the beneficial effects text from patents as historical design data, constructing general evaluation criteria using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model, and introducing the Apriori model to extract strong association rules between criteria to complete the incomplete semantics. Second, a fuzzy measure model for DMs is constructed based on intuitionistic fuzzy cross-entropy and Shapley value method, supporting the allocation of DMs' interactive weights. Then, the fuzzy Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is used to transform the multi-criteria decision model into a belief fusion problem of CS that avoids aggregating the evaluation semantics of non-compensatory criteria and outputting the optimal CS with interval credibility. A practical case study of an in-pipe inspection robot will be employed to validate the proposed approach, sensitivity analysis and comparison results confirmed that the complement data have the reliability to avoid continuous investment in the evaluation process.},

	abstract = {Identification, interpretation and response to customer requirements are the key success factors for companies, regardless of their industry. Failing to satisfy customer requirements can damage a company's reputation and cause heavy losses. In this study, we have developed a new approach for properly interpreting and analyzing the fuzzy voice of the customer using association rule learning and text mining. This unique methodology converts textual and qualitative data into a common quantitative format which is then used to develop a mapped Integrated Customer Satisfaction Index (ICSI). ICSI is a framework for measuring customer satisfaction. Previous measures of customer satisfaction ratio failed to incorporate the cost implications of resolving customer complaints/issues and the fuzzy impact of those complaints/issues on the system. In addition to including these important and unique factors in the present study, we have also introduced a dynamic Critical to Quality (CTQ) concept, a novel method that provides a real-time system to monitor the CTQ list through an updated CTQ library. Finally, a procedure for customer feedback mining and sentiment analysis is proposed that handles typographical errors, which are unavoidable in every real database. The results of this study suggest that incorporating the fuzzy level of negativity and positivity of comments into the model instead of treating negative and positive comments as binary variables, leads to more reasonable outcomes. In addition, this study provides a more structured framework for understanding customer requirements. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This exerts a great pressure on fashion designers who are urged to consider customers' preferences in their designs and develop new products efficiently. Historical data related to product design and customer purchasing behavior thus serves as important information for effective new product development (NPD). In this paper, a fuzzy-rule based system (FBS) is developed to discover relationships between product styles and customer preferences from historical data. The knowledge discovered can help the industry design products which are not only fashionable, but are also saleable in the market. To evaluate the proposed system, a case study is conducted in which a real-set of data are tested to generate fuzzy decision rules.

	abstract = {Customer satisfaction is an important indicator of user preferences for products which directly influence customers' purchase intentions. It is also an essential Kansei factor for enterprises to successfully develop products. Therefore, the objective of this study is to apply the fuzzy weighted association rule mining (FWARM) approach to extract the significant association between customer satisfaction and product form features, thus providing specific parameter guidelines for the enterprise's business decisions. In previous research, the fuzzy association rule mining (FARM) approach has proved to be a promising way forwards. However, the absence of consideration of the weight of items is always criticized as creating an uninteresting rule with high frequency and low importance. Therefore, in this study the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) is used to calculate the weight of each item in the early stage of data mining, and filters out items with a high degree of consensus. Then, the FARM method extracts the fuzzy weighted association rule. Taking the household exercise bike as an example, the authors find that handlebar, LCD screen, rack, main outline and pedestal are vital item features. Subsequently, the method is used to identify 14 rules to inform the development of the exercise bike's form to achieve high customer satisfaction; valuable knowledge support is provided for manufacturers and designers in the initial stage of new product development, potentially improving customer satisfaction and reducing the risk of product failure. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

This entails a number of technical challenges to be addressed, such as the elicitation, evaluation, and fulfillment of affective needs, as well as the evaluation of affordability of producers to launch the planned products. Mass customization and personalization have been recognized as an effective means to enhance front-end customer satisfaction while maintaining back-end production efficiency. This paper proposes an affective design framework to facilitate decision-making in designing customized product ecosystems. In particular, ambient intelligence techniques are applied to elicit affective customer needs. An analytical model is proposed to support affective design analysis. Utility measure and conjoint analysis are employed to quantify affective satisfaction, while the producer affordability is evaluated using an affordability index. Association rule mining techniques are applied to model the mapping of affective needs to design elements. Configuration design of product ecosystems is optimized with a heuristic genetic algorithm. A case study of Volvo truck cab design is reported with a focus on the customization of affective features. It is demonstrated that the analytical affective design framework can effectively manage the elicitation, analysis, and fulfillment of affective customer needs. Meanwhile, it can account for the manufacturer's capabilities, which is vital for ensuring a profit margin in the mass customization and personalization endeavor. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Fierce competition in the global market forces companies to satisfy all aspects of customers’ needs during the product design stage. Among the customers’ needs, affective needs are difficult to satisfy since understanding the affective needs of customers is a challenging task. Therefore, Kansei Engineering (KE), which is capable of transforming the affective needs of customers into product design form elements, has been widely used in literature. In KE, there are two types of systems: Forward KE and Backward KE. In the forward KE, Kansei words are inputs of the system and product design form elements are outputs of the system, while the product design form elements are inputs and Kansei words are outputs of the system in the backward KE. In this study, fuzzy linguistic summarization is proposed to extract fuzzy rules in the form of “if–then” rules that associate customers’ affective needs into product design form elements for both backward and forward KE. The brute force approach and genetic algorithm (GA) are used to obtain the most useful linguistic summaries supported by enough data, efficiently. Furthermore, fuzzy association rule mining using the Apriori algorithm is employed to compare the obtained results of fuzzy linguistic summarization. A case study is conducted on cradle design to illustrate the applicability of the proposed fuzzy linguistic summarization and the fuzzy association rule mining. Even though the brute force approach is the best option to generate linguistic summaries, it could not be efficiently used in the design of complex products since its time complexity is exponential; and therefore, GA could be used to generate linguistic summaries in an efficient way when time complexity of the approaches is compared. The results show that fuzzy linguistic summarization is an effective and powerful tool to capture the affective needs of customers.},

	abstract = {Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) are one of the representative techniques in developing scenarios that include future concepts and issues, as well as their causal relationships. The technique, initially dependent on deductive modeling of expert knowledge, suffered from inherent limitations of scope and subjectivity; though this lack has been partially addressed by the recent emergence of inductive modeling, the fact that inductive modeling uses a retrospective, historical data that often misses trend-breaking developments. Addressing this issue, the paper suggests the utilization of futuristic data, a collection of future-oriented opinions extracted from online communities of large participation, in scenario building. Because futuristic data is both large in scope and prospective in nature, we believe a methodology based on this particular data set addresses problems of subjectivity and myopia suffered by the previous modeling techniques. To this end, text mining (TM) and latent semantic analysis (LSA) algorithm are applied to extract scenario concepts from futuristic data in textual documents; and fuzzy association rule mining (FARM) technique is utilized to identify their causal weights based on if-then rules. To illustrate the utility of proposed approach, a case of electric vehicle is conducted. The suggested approach can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of scanning knowledge for scenario development.},

	abstract = {The proposed research work develops a system focused on business opportunities to enhance market returns and improve marketing strategies and new strategies by identifying how customers interact with products and their behavior. Existing research efforts attempt to identify and market consumer attraction to products and marketplace in the marketplace. Current research focuses on the challenges of identifying consumer buying patterns and how consumers interact with products, Existing research has not, however, integrated the essential elements into a single system. Consequently, the recommended study has been conducted on a number of significant issues, such as determining the high-value client base and the number of sectors, understanding the purchasing pattern of products that comprise the customers' basket, identifying customer lifetime value, and Customer Trajectory Determination for identifying customer attractive shelf. This system focuses on various machine learning algorithms. Customer segmentation and value analysis using K Mean, Agglomerative, Clustering algorithm, and Arima model. Association rules are generated using the Apriori algorithm for market basket analysis, which is built on the idea that a set of frequently purchased items is a subset of a set of frequently purchased items. Also using RFM analysis to create and prepare our data frame by using BG/NBD model and the Gamma-Gamma model to calculate the customer lifetime value standardization. Using image processing algorithms and retail video analysis algorithms, background reduction technology clearly identifies moving objects/tracks customer routes using different colors. Based on results from implementation and testing, it was determined that the suggested technique outperformed the use of CCTV to identify consumer behavior and satisfaction with the product in recognizing customer purchasing patterns. The proposed system can identify customers' buying patterns, how customers interact with products, and their satisfaction, and thus focus on business opportunities, improving trade returns, improving marketing strategies, and new strategies. © 2022 IEEE.},

While some existing techniques can help identify ONBs, most of them are not systematic and algorithmic, and also they require a lot of human effort. In this paper, we propose an algorithmic and systematic approach for knowledge acquisition of ONBs in componentbased systems using a modified Apriori algorithm. Our approach analyzes component state transition rules to identify dependencies among components, which are used to group components that are dependent on each other into component sets. These sets are used for analysis of possible ONBs. We conducted an empirical study to evaluate our approach. Our results indicate that the component sets generated using our approach are able to expose missing dependencies and ONBs with much less human effort when compared to CCM. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Changing customer needs coupled with rapid technology advances has boosted stronger requirements for a greater variety of consumer electronics. This trend has forced global companies to reconsider their product-positioning strategies. To reduce design cost and shorten the time to market, portfolio analysis for product family design is usually adopted to acquire diverse but related market applications. This study presents a novel framework to implement product differentiation and product configuration. Initially, association rule mining is used to capture user perceptions to identify the significant portfolios of hedonic attributes. Secondly, cognitive pairwise rating is conducted to elicit user preferences for utilitarian attributes (UAs). Finally, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution is used to prioritize the optimal portfolios of UAs. Experiment results show that “keyboard interface”, “body material”, and “screen size” are the most concerned HAs for differentiating the product family while “CPU performance” is the most important UA for configuring padbooks, ultrabooks and notebooks. In summary, this research allows companies to effectively and efficiently incorporate user perceptions or preferences into the entire decision-making process. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Industrial products integrate highly configurable safety-critical systems which must be intensively tested before being delivered to customers. This process is highly time-consuming and may require associations between product features and requirements demanded by customers. Machine Learning (ML) has proven to help engineers in this task, through automation of associations between features and requirements, where the latter are prioritized first. However, ML application can be more difficult when requirements are written in natural language (NL), and if it does not exist a ground truth dataset with them. This work presents SRXCRM, a Natural Language Processing-based model able to extract and associate components from product design specifications and customer requirements, written in NL, of safety-critical systems. The model has a Weight Association Rule Mining framework that defines associations between components, generating visualizations that can help engineers in prioritization of the most impactful features. Preliminary results of the use of SRXCRM show that it can extract such associations and visualizations. © 2021 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.},

Nevertheless, traditional methods remain inadequate for effectively leveraging historical configuration knowledge and rapidly generating new configuration design schemes devoid of established references. Inspired by the combined effects of the associative learning of the cerebellum and the reward modulation learning of the basal ganglia on goal-oriented behaviours, this paper proposes a cognitive computing method for product configuration design based on associative rule mining and deep reinforcement learning. For one thing, the benchmark learning-based association rule mining method, which simulates the cerebellum's function, automatically extracts configuration design knowledge that connects customer requirements with module instances, thereby promoting the end-to-end reusing of historical configuration design solutions. For another, the improved deep Q-network is proposed to mimic the function of the basal ganglia, which is employed to generate new configuration design schemes in the absence of historical precedents. A case study on the configuration design of the essential service water system of a nuclear power plant is implemented to demonstrate the reliability and reasonability of the proposed approach. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Identifying new product opportunities must be a prerequisite for a firm's sustainable growth since it can help create new market segments. In this regard, a number of studies have attempted to suggest systematic methods to discover new technological opportunities. However, from these methods, it is difficult to figure out which products can come into the market as a result of the technological opportunities. Moreover, they have tried to measure generic potential values without considering a specific target firm so it is hard to judge whether the discovered opportunities are technically feasible to the target firm. These problems tend to reduce the practicality of the discovered technological opportunities. Therefore, this paper proposes a systematic approach to identify potential product opportunities by reflecting the target firm's internal capabilities. The capabilities are inherently unobservable so we need to figure out substitutes for the firm's capabilities. The existing products belonging to a firm can be generally a basis for developing new products. The firm is already good at dealing with the existing products so we consider the firm's existing product portfolios its internal capabilities. We first extract product information from patent database using text mining technique, and then generate product connection rules represented as directed pairs of products. Finally, we evaluate potential value of product opportunities taking into account a firm's internal capabilities. An empirical study is conducted to show the applicability of the presented approach using patents granted in the United States Patent and Trademark Office during 2009 and 2013. We expect that our approach can facilitate product-oriented R\&D by presenting a front-end model for new product development and deriving feasible product opportunities according to the target firm's internal capabilities. Moreover, the presented systematic approach can be a basis for an R\&D planning system that can help R\&D planners in performing product-oriented technology planning activities. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

Second, the clustering algorithm is performed fuzzy-c-means, to segment customers into clusters with similar characteristics.

The algorithm has a slight improvement in the efficiency of the algorithm. Compared with FP-Growth algorithm, it also has an improvement in the acquisition of frequent itemsets.

	abstract = {Customer segmentation is not only limited to the identification of user groups but searching and determining the attitude of individual customer groups toward a particular product or service aside helping organization in developing better marketing strategies. Many studies have proposed different techniques for customer segmentation, but some of these studies failed to examine individual customer’s needs in the cluster. In a customer segmentation, when customers are grouped into various cluster based on their common needs, there may be customers that have other needs that differ from the general needs of the group. In a situation where the needs of individual were not captured, organizations may find it difficult to control the rendering of their services. The aim of this study is to extract the individual customer’ needs to enhance organizations’ services that meet the needs of customers, as well as increase organization profits. This study, therefore, proposes the use of an associative rules mining algorithm augmented with assignment optimization to properly examine the needs of individual customers in the group. This approach enhances the cross-segmentation of customers for better marketing strategies and the assignment technique also improved the segmentation processing speed. The degree of accuracy of the system developed was tested with about 9,500 customers’ dataset that was obtained from goggle multi category online store dataset. Both customer transaction history dataset and customer purchasing behavior dataset were obtained for segmentation which achieved 94.5\% customer segmentation accuracy.

Then DBSCAN algorithm based on density is introduced to classify the customers into three groups (the first, the second and the third class). Finally biclustering based on FP-tree algorithm is used in the three groups to obtain more detailed information. Experimental results on the dataset of an airline company show that the biclustering could segment the customers more accurately and meticulously. Compared with biclustering based on Apriori, the Fptree is more efficient on the large dataset. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to address this. In this work, we propose an approach based on association rule mining to identify mapping relationships between functions and technologies. These mapping relationships not only enable companies to reuse proven knowledge about functions and technologies but also help them to effectively decide on technologies and details.

This paper focuses on creating guidelines that are applicable during the early stages of designing inclusive products. Actionfunction diagrams are used to formally compare existing inclusive products to their typical counterparts to study the design similarities and differences in the context of accessibility. A data mining technique, association rule learning, generates rules through comparison of inclusive and typical product data. In prior work, generation of function-based association rules for inclusive design has been performed on a smaller scale using this method; this research seeks to extend and formalize the same method, by studying a larger set of inclusive products. Trends in the generation of rules are analyzed indicating that a finite set of rules should be applicable to an arbitrarily large set of products. Further, the rules are analyzed in detail to evaluate their potential for transferability and reuse from one product to another. Of particular interest is the transferability of the rules across apparently disparate product domains such as garden tools and residential furniture. The conceptual and physical similarity of the rules is discussed in the context of creating inclusive product families based on a platform of inclusive elements. Copyright © 2013 by ASME.},

An association rule discovery model is employed to extract association relationships between existing and/or previous products and the systems used to assemble them. The extracted knowledge is used to synthesize assembly systems for new products that fall within the scope of their predecessors. The developed method is demonstrated using two examples from the automotive industry. System synthesis results that are consistent with the used assembly data instances are obtained in both examples. The presented systematic system synthesis method supports the utilization of existing legacy data in developing assembly systems for new product generations.

	abstract = {Purpose - Product configuration is considered as one of the most successful applications of knowledge-based approaches in the past decade. Knowledge-based configurations can be classified into three different approaches, namely, rule-based, model-based and case-based approaches. Past research has mainly focused on the development of reasoning techniques for mapping requirements to configurations. Despite the success of certain conventional approaches, the acquisition of configuration knowledge is usually done manually. This paper aims to explore fundamental issues in product configuration system, and propose a novel approach based on data mining techniques to automatically discover configuration knowledge in constraint-based configurations. Design/methodology/ approach - Given a set of product data comprising product requirements specification and configuration information, the paper adopted an association rule mining algorithm to discover useful patterns between requirement specification and product components, as well as the correlation among product components. A configuration was developed which takes XML-based requirement specification as input and bases on a constraint knowledge base to produce product configuration as output consisting of a list of selected components and the structure and topology of the product. Three modules are developed, namely product data modelling, configuration knowledge generation and product configuration generation module. The proposed approach is implemented in the configuration knowledge generation module. The configuration generation module realizes a resolution of constraint satisfaction problem to generate the output configuration. Findings - The significance and effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by its incorporation in our configuration system prototype. A case study was conducted and experimental results show that the approach is promising in finding constraints with given sufficient data. Originality/value - Novel knowledge generation approach is proposed to assist constraint generation for Constraint-based product configuration system. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Customer segmentation is typically done by applying some form of cluster analysis to obtain a set of segments to which future customers are assigned to.

Among them, product optimization design is the most important link, which determines whether an enterprise can achieve sustainable development in the market of fierce competition. For this reason, enterprises must implement various competitive strategies in terms of product diversity and characteristics. To solve this challenge, optimizing innovative product design is the key to help enterprises gain competitive advantage in the market. This paper presents a product optimization design based on online review and orthogonal experiment under the background of big data to meet customer needs. First, the big data of online reviews are collected from the web platform through the data collector, and the original data are processed by the apriori algorithm. Secondly, the fuzzy clustering was used to analyze the processed online reviews data to obtain customer needs. Finally, the product is optimized by orthogonal test based on customer needs. This paper analyzes the case of Huawei Honor 9 mobile phone, and obtains that the product appearance is the most concerned and dissatisfied product attribute of customers, and then optimizes the design of product appearance to improve customer satisfaction. Through this method, enterprises can improve the design of products according to the needs of customers in time, effectively overcome the defects of products, and help enterprises to establish a good relationship with customers, so as to promote the sustainable development of enterprises in the competitive market. © IMechE 2020.},

	abstract = {New energy vehicles (NEVs) such as electronic cars represent a major trend in the automobile industry, where most their exterior designs still follow those of convention fuelled vehicles (FVs). It is important to investigate whether NEV users have unique requirements that differ from those of traditional users. Kansei engineering is a practical tool for perceptual demand analysis. However, the conventional method requires questionnaires or surveys to perform limited data collection. In this study, we utilised massive internet data to collect user Kansei requirements for NEV exterior design. The Scrapy crawler was adopted for data collection and a bidirectional long short-term memory, conditional random field, and multilayer perceptron framework was developed for text mining. To quantify design features and Kansei image scores, a hybrid Apriori + structural equation model (SEM) system is proposed, where the data-driven Apriori algorithm can explore the hidden relationships in big user generated comments, while the SEM model captures the users’ behaviour and decision procedure so that to provide interpretable results. In addition, the association rules mined from user comments by Apriori can facilitate the specification of a complicated SEM model, substantially reducing the modelling and calibration effort. Goodness-of-fit results suggest that the proposed model outperforms conventional models. A case study on 1805 automobiles, 287 brands, and 369105 comments was conducted and the results suggest that some design features that would increase the Kansei image scores for conventional FVs may have the opposite effect on NEVs. Discussions on engineering and managerial insights are presented and the discovered rules and relationships are employed to develop a design-aided system. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Aiming at the problems that the semantic knowledge of the operation and maintenance stage is not integrated into the configuration design process and it is difficult to obtain the implicit configuration knowledge, this research proposes a maintainability configuration design method for complex products based on a knowledge graph. Firstly, an ontology is constructed to represent the design domain knowledge, maintenance service knowledge, and the semantic relationships between them. Combined with the enterprise database, the maintainability configuration design knowledge graph is constructed as the configuration model. Knowledge graph and FP-Growth are used to mine objective configuration rules and update the rules into the model. Then, the pellet reasoner is used to solve the physical architecture that meets the order requirements of the customer. An optimization model is established, which aims at the maximum maintenance efficiency and the minimum life cycle cost of the product, and the NSGA-II algorithm is used to solve the optimization model to obtain the configuration scheme. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed method is verified by taking the drive device and wheelset composition of a high-speed train bogie as a case study. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.},

How to design products quickly and reasonable according to the market demand has become an urgent problem in the development of industrial robots. The traditional design method of robots is mainly in accordance with experience, or functional analysis and module division of industrial robots which needs a lot of time cost and resources. In order to improve the design efficiency of industrial robots, this paper proposes a design method based on association rules through knowledge mining in which the robot structural feature parameters are accumulated and utilized. In this process, the K-means clustering method is used to discretize the data through the Euclidean metric between the feature parameters, and then the association relationships are mined by using the Apriori. Finally the association rules are summarized according to the physical meaning of the structural usefeature parameters. The method proposed in this paper provides a scientific basis for the rapid design of robots and improves the rationality of robot design. © IEOM Society International.},

In particular, it is observed that the boundaries between smart phones, digital cameras, and tablets are becoming more and more blurred than before. Therefore, for attracting the ad-hoc segments, global companies began to develop hybrid pad-phones and phone-cameras. Unfortunately, some of these products are facing poor sales without incurring much market attention. In order to overcome the aforementioned difficulty, this paper presents a novel framework to reduce the gaps between producer expectation and user perception. By means of the TRIZ (the theory of inventive problem solving), a contradiction matrix is applied to handle engineering conflicts among multi-functional alternatives to seek inventive solutions. Then, ARM (association rule mining) is conducted to identify critical features that formulate customer dissatisfaction (purchase intention). Finally, CA (conjoint analysis) is employed to derive customer utilities for benchmarking varieties of design concepts. In summary, the proposed framework cannot only help product planners efficiently generate innovative ideas, but also effectively justify the validity of design concepts. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

The process of the knowledge discovery in design instances mainly includes the following steps. First, more than 1000 design instances were collected. Three standardized systems, including structure symmetry system, design requirement system, and structure design principle system, were built. Then the design instances were analyzed based on the three standardized systems. Second, a physical database was designed, and the information of design instances was stored in the database. Third, the association rules among structure symmetry, design requirement, and structure design principle were mined using association rule mining algorithm. Finally, the design knowledge of structure symmetry in realizing design requirements was proposed by analyzing mining results and relevant instances.

In view of the fact that traditional kansei engineering can not effectively reflect the complex and changeable psychological factors of users, and it has not explored the complex relationship between customer satisfaction and perceptual demand characteristics. To address this problem, some uncertainty techniques including rough sets and fuzzy sets are applied to capture more accurate emotion knowledge. Therefore, this research proposes an integrated evaluation gird method (EGM), rough set theory (RST), continuous fuzzy kano model (CFKM), fuzzy weighted association rule mining method to extract the significant relationship between user needs and product morphological features. The EGM is applied to analyze the attractive factor of morphological characteristics of the product, and then the demand items with the highest satisfaction are analyzed through CFKM. The semantic difference method is combined to construct a decision table, and through attribute reduction and importance calculation to obtain the weight of the core product design items. In order to explore the non-linear relationship between design elements and kansei images, the fuzzy weighted association rule mining method was applied to obtain the set of frequent fuzzy weighted association rules based on evidence theory's reliability indices of minimum support and confidence so as to realize user demand-driven product design. Taking the design of electric bicycle as an example, the experiment results show that the proposed method can help companies or designers develop products to generate good solutions for customer need. © 2021 - IOS Press.

Root cause analysis is an important and challenging task in exploring this mechanism in the era of quality and big data. Therefore, a novel big data oriented root cause identification approach based on weighted association rule mining (WARM) is proposed in this paper. First, the mechanism is expounded based on big data in the product lifecycle, and the requirements of root cause identification are determined simultaneously. Second, in view of domain mapping theory in Axiomatic design, the associated tree is proposed to provide a framework for the root cause search and identification. Then, the big data of root causes is defined based on the proposed associated tree. Third, a root cause mining technique using the WARM is presented, and the weight computation approach for the node on the associated tree based on the weight confidence is provided. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is verified by a case study on mining root causes for severe infant failure of an automatic washing machine. The final result shows that the proposed approach is conducive to heuristically identify the root causes of the complicated product infant failure from the big data of product lifecycle. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Presently, modern B2B supply chain management (B2B-SCM) equipped with semi-automated data logging systems accumulate large volumes. However, each SC unit in B2B-SC still individually develops their performance. Besides, their linkages of performance attributes between SC units still lack vital information extraction to improve theirs. Therefore, this paper aims to propose an integrated framework between B2B supply chain (B2B-SC) performance evaluation systems and data mining techniques, developing relationship rules of collaborative performance attribute enhancement. The methodology is as follows. Firstly, B2B-SC performance evaluation questionnaires based on two levels able to characterize collaborative relation between two or more partners in their SC were gathered from the case study companies. The data set of relationships between enterprise and its direct customers of the case study companies in France was used for demonstration. Secondly, data cleaning and preparations for rule extraction were performed on the questionnaire database. The significance of attribute was calculated using attribute ranking algorithms by means of information gain based on ranker search. These results were used to choose the crucial attributes from each micro view. Thirdly, web graph analysis was performed on this data to confirm the strong attribute relationship. Next, association rule was deployed to extract performance attribute relationship rules grounded on support and confidence cross validation method. The quality of each recognized rule is tested and, from numerous rules, only those that are statistically very strong and contain vital information are selected. Last but not least, these rules are interpreted by domain experts and studied by domain engineers to build a collaborative performance attribute enhancement road map. Furthermore, the final rule set of extracted rules contains very interesting information relating to SCs and also point out the critical existing SC attribute improvement. Ultimately, companies in this SC are able to use this framework to design and adjust their units to conform with the exact customer needs.},

A data mining algorithm is adopted for the knowledge database of the supplier characteristic involved in the product cooperation design, which is based on the aggregative chains and the association rule that the components of the supplier's characteristics must satisfy the requirement of the product reliability. The sets of the components of the supplier reliability characteristics are resolved by the improved FP-Growth algorithm. The evaluation model of the hierarchy of the supplier reliability is given in this paper. The AHP method is applied to find the synthesis scale value of the supplier reliability characteristics.

	abstract = {Affective design has received much attention from both academia and industries. It aims at incorporating customers' affective needs into design elements that deliver customers' affective satisfaction. The main challenge for affective design originates from difficulties in mapping customers' subjective impressions, namely Kansei, to perceptual design elements. This paper intends to develop an explicit decision support to improve the Kansei mapping process by reusing knowledge from past sales records and product specifications. As one of the important applications of data mining, association rule mining lends itself to the discovery of useful patterns associated with the mapping of affective needs. A Kansei mining system is developed to utilize valuable affect information latent in customers' impressions of existing affective designs. The goodness of association rules is evaluated according to their achievements of customers' expectations. Conjoint analysis is applied to measure the expected and achieved utilities of a Kansei mapping relationship. Based on goodness evaluation, mapping rules are further refined to empower the system with useful inference patterns. The system architecture and implementation issues are discussed in detail. An application of Kansei mining to mobile phone affective design is presented. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the current manufacturing environment of intense competition, mass customization becomes a crucial capability for a company to survive. Acquiring and identifying customer needs is an important aspect of mass customization. Emotional terms are often included in the description of customer needs and customer evaluations. At the same time, products that consider emotion responses and evoke positive emotions tend to attract customers. Thus, emotional design has been proposed to incorporate customer emotional needs into design elements to deliver customer emotional satisfaction. The main challenge of emotional design originates from difficulties in mapping customers' subjective emotions to perceptual design elements. This paper proposed an association rule mining approach to provide emotional design decision support where the basic requirements can be identified. This approach applies rule mining on customer evaluations and product specifications. Three main steps - data preprocessing, association rule mining, and rule evaluation - are involved in this approach. Data preprocessing extracts critical emotional terms and perceptual design elements from data sources. Data provided by similar customers are grouped. For each customer group, association rule mining is applied on the emotional terms and associated design elements to find out implicit relationships between them. Support level, confidence level and freshness of supporting data of the rules are used to evaluate and rank the applicability of the rules. The proposed approach is illustrated by a case study on emotional design for a series of mobile phones.},

This step can take a long time to perform on a complex model and can be tedious in nature. In this paper, we present a rule-based approach to feature suppression. We have developed a decision-tree based representation for capturing feature suppression rules. We have also developed utilities in Pro/Engineer CAD system to identify features that meet these rules and suppress them.

This paper mines a set of errors frequently observed in use case models and sequence diagrams created by novice analysts, and develops propositions identifying intra- and inter-artifacts quality.

	abstract = {To survive in today's market, decision makers including investors and their managerial teams should continuously attempt to realize the customers' unspoken needs and requirements by discovering their behavioral patterns. Discovering customers' patterns puts these decision makers in a better position in which higher qualified services can be designed and provided. Association rule mining is a well-known approach to discover these patterns. Although extracted rules could express customers' behaviors in an easy-to-understand way, the number of rules in real applications could be problematic. Moreover, the customers' comments are not usually considered for constructing/evaluating the rules. To tackle these issues, a system framework is proposed in this paper in which all association rules are clustered using a new similarity measure. For each cluster, a new type of graph is developed known as sub-graph in this paper. Each sub-graph has unique messages that can partially contribute to designing new services. Furthermore, for the first time, the real satisfaction levels are embedded into the association rules to enrich them in an innovative way. The main interesting point is that the satisfaction levels are only assessed for the overall system, not for current services. We also illustrate how our proposed methodology works through artificial and real datasets and also demonstrate the superiority of our proposed clustering algorithm compared to other popular methods.},

Hence, we propose an intelligent approach to facilitate the risk analysis of a change request by providing information about past cases found in similar change requests, the solutions adopted, and a support tool. The proposed approach uses casebased reasoning to retrieve previous cases similar to the current case. This approach also uses association rules to analyze patterns in the dataset and calculate the probability of risks associated with change requests. We prepared a case study to validate the proposal by analyzing the most frequent challenges in change management and considering how it can solve or minimize such problems. Results show that the proposed approach successfully assists decision-making, predicts potential risks, and suggests coherent solutions to the user. We have developed a support tool to evaluate this approach in practice with experts and obtained four different outcomes. Only a small set of cases failed to provide relevant results to the user. The use of case-based reasoning and association rules has proven to be advantageous in change management despite validity threats associated with the small number of test cases and experts involved.},

However, the widespread existence of symmetry in applied science is not in direct proportion to the attention it has received. Through a large number of examples studies, almost all mechanical structures are found to have symmetry, and most of them have the characteristics of point group symmetry. Therefore, the concept of point group symmetry in crystallography was extended to the field of machinery and adjusted according to the mechanical structures. First of all, the classification of mechanical point group symmetry is proposed, and how point group symmetry is applied in machinery is illustrated with examples. Then, the requirements of symmetry are analyzed and compared. Furthermore, the data mining software RapidMiner is used to mine the association rules between requirements and symmetry. Based on the mining results, the four selection principles of point group symmetry are summarized to provide ideas for structure design. Finally, a new type of gear pump with radial force balancing is invented by comprehensively using the mining results and selection principles.},
