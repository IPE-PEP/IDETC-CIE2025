Conical origami structures in particular have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to their excellent energy absorption performance. However, the design of conical structures with customizable geometry and folding morphology has remained a less researched research area. The adaptable design of conical origami structures should be supported. To this end, the geometric relationships between the 2D bend patterns and 3D structures were first derived to determine the critical parameters.

An automated extraction and analysis of customer-related content has not yet been examined in detail. Customer-related content refers to information within a review that does not primarily concern the product, but information about the customer itself, its usage behaviour, personal environment and habits. These information is usually expressed objectively by the author (i.e. customers) and represents an authentic starting point for the identification of customer needs. In particular, for the innovative product development, the essential consideration of customer's product habits and environment are the derivative of products.",

In this research, we propose with sentiment analysis and social media mining an automatic engine that can be used for better product recommendation and automatic routing of relevant feedback to product development teams. A solution is tried to run periodically, pulling dynamic reviews in an optimized way with less time complexity and higher efficiency. The reviews are compiled by distributed platforms and must be classified according to the respective companies.

The traditional ship design process includes only independent design optimization with some regression formulas in each discipline and there is no guarantee for optimal design. At the same time, it is crucial to improve the efficiency of modern ship design. Nowadays, the methods of calculation fluid dynamics (CFD) have been introduced into ship design optimization. However, there are still some problems such as calculation precision and time consumption especially when CFD software is incorporated into the optimization process. Modeling is a far-reaching and all-round issue, and its precision directly influences the scientific decision in the future. How to create an accurate approximation model instead of CFD calculation is the central problem. The optimization model should be brought closer and updated during the optimization process to improve accuracy.",
