Acquiring and identifying customer needs is an important aspect of mass customization. Emotional terms are often included in the description of customer needs and customer evaluations. At the same time, products that consider emotion responses and evoke positive emotions tend to attract customers. Thus, emotional design has been proposed to incorporate customer emotional needs into design elements to deliver customer emotional satisfaction. Customers' subjective emotions should be mapped to perceptual design features.",

        "Sentence": "During the design process, designers must satisfy customer needs while adequately developing engineering objectives. Among these engineering objectives, human considerations such as user interactions, safety, and comfort are indispensable during the design process. Nevertheless, traditional design engineering methodologies have significant limitations incorporating and understanding physical user interactions during early design phases. For example, Human Factors methods use checklists and guidelines applied to virtual or physical prototypes at later design stages to evaluate the concept. As a result, designers struggle to identify design deficiencies and potential failure modes caused by user-system interactions without relying on the use of detailed and costly prototypes. Therefore, the relationships between components, functions, flows, and user interactions should be explored. Design information related to components, functions, flows, and user interactions from a set of distinct coffee makers found in the Design Repository should be extracted to create association rules.",

As a global automotive supplier, Mubea develops novel manufacturing technologies for new products in the electric powertrain. One example in the battery case of battery electric vehicles is the thermal management system of the traction batteries—a key factor in the battery case. As a new production technology for this product, the Mubea Rollbonding Process of aluminum offers several advantages, such as a high design freedom of the channel structure. For the product development—even though Mubea consequently makes use of automated simulation workflows—the turn-around time of a single CFD performance evaluation is still high. Based on all the historic simulation results from past projects, a predictive model that allows the prediction of simulation results in real-time should be built. Therefore, 3D geometries should be processed as such.",

Flow fields (e.g., pressure fields) on the surface of the geometry and any overall scalar parameters (e.g., drag force) given a three-dimensional shape input should be predicted.",

Warranty claims analysis is a key activity for product support and product development technicians. A widely used source of information is a set of documents, referred to as “Claim Comments” that are filled in by mechanics during repairs. Repair records include valuable information as failure modes descriptions, diagnosis and troubleshooting, potential causes, and other useful details. The information is then fed back for customer/field support and continuous product improvement. Claims details review is mostly executed manually, and engineers need to read thousands of lines each year. This task is constrained by human limitations - e.g., ability of consistently identifying failure modes and the limited number of documents that can be processed at once. A solution is sought to make the analysis of such massive documents more scalable and efficient. The analysis should not be limited to single word occurrences but should rely on the overall text context understanding. Based on the information given in the documents, topics should be identified.

Thus, TRIZ evolved from a set of empirical inventive principles into a considerably formal approach including techniques for modeling technical problems with the possibility of further overcoming them using formal methods. Moreover, during the last decades, TRIZ has been extensively digitized. Several generations of software have appeared that facilitate the use of inventive methods (Goldfire, Invention Machine).
